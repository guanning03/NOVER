Answer the question and return in the following format:

<answer>
...
</answer>
","To ensure the original function is meaningful, we need to satisfy the conditions $\begin{cases} 2x+1\geqslant 0\\2x^{2}-x-1\neq 0\end{cases}$. Solving these, we find $x > - \dfrac {1}{2}$ and $x\neq 1$.  
Therefore, the domain of the function $f(x)= \dfrac { \sqrt {2x+1}}{2x^{2}-x-1}$ is $\boxed{\{x|x > - \dfrac {1}{2} \text{ and } x\neq 1\}}$.  
This is derived by solving the system of inequalities that comes from requiring the expression inside the square root to be greater than or equal to $0$ and the denominator of the fraction to not be $0$.  
This question tests the understanding of the domain of a function and its calculation methods, making it a basic computational problem.",train

Question: The Wuhan Metro project is underway and will provide convenience for residents once it is operational. It is known that the time interval t (in minutes) between train departures on a certain line satisfies 10 ≤ t ≤ 30. Market research and calculations have shown that the number of passengers on the train is related to the time interval t. When 20 ≤ t ≤ 30, the train is fully loaded with 500 passengers. When 10 ≤ t < 20, the number of passengers decreases from the fully loaded state, and this decrease is proportional to the square of (20 - t). When the train departure time interval is 12 minutes, there are 244 passengers on the train. Denote the number of passengers on the train as P(t).

1. Find the expression for P(t) and determine the number of passengers when the train departure time interval is 18 minutes.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","(This question is worth a total of 12 points)  
Solution:  
(Ⅰ) $f(x) = \cos(\omega x - \frac{\pi}{3}) - \cos(\omega x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\sin(\omega x) - \frac{1}{2}\cos(\omega x) = \sin(\omega x - \frac{\pi}{6})$, (3 points)  
Since the graph of function $f(x)$ is symmetric about the line $x = \pi$, we have: $\omega\pi - \frac{\pi}{6} = k\pi + \frac{\pi}{2}$ $(k \in \mathbb{Z})$,  
Therefore, $\omega = k + \frac{2}{3}$ $(k \in \mathbb{Z})$,  
Since $\omega \in (1, 2)$,  
Therefore, $k = 1, \omega = \frac{5}{3}$, (5 points)  
Thus, $f(x) = \sin(\frac{5}{3}x - \frac{\pi}{6})$, then the smallest positive period of function $f(x)$ is $T = \frac{2\pi}{\frac{5}{3}} = \frac{6\pi}{5}$, (6 points)  
(Ⅱ) From (Ⅰ), we know $f(x) = \sin(\frac{5}{3}x - \frac{\pi}{6})$,  
Therefore, $f(\frac{3}{5}A) = \sin(A - \frac{\pi}{6}) = \frac{1}{2}$, (7 points)  
Since $0 < A < \pi$,  
Therefore, $- \frac{\pi}{6} < A - \frac{\pi}{6} < \frac{5\pi}{6}$,  
Therefore, $A - \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{\pi}{6}$, $A = \frac{\pi}{3}$, (9 points)  
By the law of cosines and $a=1$, we get: $1 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\cos\frac{\pi}{3} \geq 2bc - bc = bc$, hence $bc \leq 1$, (11 points)  
Therefore, $S_{\triangle ABC} = \frac{1}{2}bc\sin A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}bc \leq \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}$,  
Therefore, the maximum area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}}$. (12 points)

Question: Given that the asymptotic equations of hyperbola $C$ are $y=± \dfrac { \sqrt {3}}{3}x$, and the coordinates of the right focus are $(2,0)$, with $O$ being the origin.  
(Ⅰ) Find the standard equation of the hyperbola $C$;  
(Ⅱ) If the line $l$: $y=kx+ \sqrt {2}$ always intersects the hyperbola $C$ at two distinct points $A$ and $B$, and $\overrightarrow{OA}\cdot \overrightarrow{OB} > 0$, determine the range of the real number $k$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Solution:  
(Ⅰ) Let the equation of the hyperbola be $\dfrac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}- \dfrac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1(a > 0,b > 0)$,  
From the given conditions, we have $c=2$, $\dfrac {b}{a}= \dfrac { \sqrt {3}}{3}$,  
and $c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}$,  
Solving these, we get $a= \sqrt {3}$, $b=1$,  
Thus, the equation of the hyperbola is $\dfrac {x^{2}}{3}-y^{2}=1$;  
(Ⅱ) Since the line $l$: $y=kx+ \sqrt {2}$ always intersects the hyperbola $C$ at two distinct points,  
Therefore, the system of equations $\begin{cases} x^{2}-3y^{2}=3 \\ y=kx+ \sqrt {2}\end{cases}$ always has two sets of different real solutions,  
Therefore, the equation $(1-3k^{2})x^{2}-6 \sqrt {2}kx-9=0$ has two different real roots,  
Therefore, $\begin{cases} \overset{1-3k^{2}\neq 0}{\triangle =72k^{2}+36(1-3k^{2}) > 0}\end{cases}$, thus $k^{2} < 1$ and $k^{2}\neq \dfrac {1}{3}$,  
Let $A(x_{1},y_{1})$, $B(x_{2},y_{2})$,  
Then $x_{1}+x_{2}= \dfrac {6 \sqrt {2}k}{1-3k^{2}}$, $x_{1}x_{2}=- \dfrac {9}{1-3k^{2}}$,  
Since $\overrightarrow{OA}\cdot \overrightarrow{OB} > 0$,  
Then $x_{1}x_{2}+y_{1}y_{2}=(1+k^{2})x_{1}x_{2}+ \sqrt {2}k(x_{1}+x_{2})+2 > 0$,  
Thus $(1+k^{2})\cdot(- \dfrac {9}{1-3k^{2}})+ \sqrt {2}k\cdot \dfrac {6 \sqrt {2}k}{1-3k^{2}}+2= \dfrac {3k^{2}+7}{3k^{2}-1} > 0$,  
We get $k^{2} > \dfrac {1}{3}$,  
Since $k^{2} < 1$,  
Therefore, the range of $k$ is $\boxed{(-1,- \dfrac { \sqrt {3}}{3})\cup( \dfrac { \sqrt {3}}{3},1)}$.",train

Question: If a function $f(x)$ satisfies that for any $x_1$, $x_2$ within its domain, $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ always implies $x_1 = x_2$, then $f(x)$ is called a tight function. For example, the function $f(x) = \ln x (x > 0)$ is a tight function. Consider the following statements:  
$①$ A tight function must be a monotonic function;  
$②$ The function $f(x) = \frac{x^2 + 2x + a}{x} (x > 0)$ is a tight function when $a < 0$;  
$③$ The function $f(x) = \begin{cases} \log_2 x, & x \geqslant 2 \\ 2-x, & x < 2 \end{cases}$ is a tight function;  
$④$ If a function $f(x)$ is a tight function within its domain and $x_1 \neq x_2$, then $f(x_1) \neq f(x_2)$;  
$⑤$ If a function $f(x)$ is a tight function and has a derivative within its domain, then its derivative $f′(x)$ must not be zero within its domain.

Question: Given that square and square root operations are inverse operations, for example, $(a^{2}±2ab+b^{2})=(a±b)^{2}$, then $\sqrt {a^{2}±2ab+b^{2}}=|a±b|$. How to simplify the double square root expression $\sqrt {a±2 \sqrt {b}}$ $(a > 0,b > 0,a±2 \sqrt {b} > 0)$? If we can find two numbers $m$ and $n$ $(m > 0,n > 0)$ such that $( \sqrt {m})^{2}+( \sqrt {n})^{2}=a$ and $\sqrt {m} \cdot \sqrt {n}= \sqrt {b}$, then $a±2 \sqrt {b}=(( \sqrt {m})^{2}+( \sqrt {n})^{2}±2 \sqrt {m}\cdot \sqrt {n}=( \sqrt {m}± \sqrt {n})^{2}$. Therefore, $\sqrt {a±2 \sqrt {b}}=| \sqrt {m}± \sqrt {n}|$, the double square root expression can be simplified. For example, simplify $\sqrt {3+2 \sqrt {2}}$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>

<answer>

</answer>
","Since $(\overrightarrow{a} + \overrightarrow{b}) \perp (2\overrightarrow{a} - \overrightarrow{b})$, their dot product is zero:
$$(\overrightarrow{a} + \overrightarrow{b}) \cdot (2\overrightarrow{a} - \overrightarrow{b}) = 0.$$
Expanding the dot product, we get:
$$2\overrightarrow{a} \cdot \overrightarrow{a} + \overrightarrow{a} \cdot \overrightarrow{b} - \overrightarrow{b} \cdot \overrightarrow{b} = 0.$$
Using the given magnitudes of $\overrightarrow{a}$ and $\overrightarrow{b}$, we can rewrite the equation as:
$$2(2)^2 + \overrightarrow{a} \cdot \overrightarrow{b} - (\sqrt{2})^2 = 0,$$
which simplifies to:
$$8 + \overrightarrow{a} \cdot \overrightarrow{b} - 2 = 0.$$
Thus,
$$\overrightarrow{a} \cdot \overrightarrow{b} = -6.$$
Now, we can find $\cos{\theta}$ using the dot product formula:
$$\cos{\theta} = \frac{\overrightarrow{a} \cdot \overrightarrow{b}}{|\overrightarrow{a}| |\overrightarrow{b}|} = \frac{-6}{2\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}.$$
Therefore, the answer is:

","Since $\cos a = \frac{2}{3}$, and $-\frac{\pi}{2} < a < 0$,

Therefore, $\frac{\tan(-a-\pi)\sin(2\pi+a)}{\cos(-a)\tan(\pi+a)} = \frac{(-\tan a)\sin a}{\cos a \tan a} = -\tan a = -\frac{-\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}$.

","To solve this problem, we can simplify the given expression by subtracting $2\pi$ from $\frac{11\pi}{6}$, since cosine is periodic with a period of $2\pi$:
$$\cos \frac{11\pi}{6} = \cos (\frac{11\pi}{6} - 2\pi) = \cos (-\frac{\pi}{6}).$$
Next, we can use the fact that cosine is an even function, meaning $\cos(-\theta) = \cos(\theta)$ for any angle $\theta$:
$$\cos (-\frac{\pi}{6}) = \cos \frac{\pi}{6}.$$
Finally, we know that $\cos \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Therefore, the correct answer is B: $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.",train

</answer>
","To make a cone-shaped container without a lid from a semicircular sheet of iron with a radius of $R$,  
let the radius of the base of the cone be $r$, then $\pi R=2\pi r$, solving this gives $r= \frac {R}{2}$,  
the slant height $l$ of the cone is $R$,  
thus, the height $h$ of the cone is $h= \sqrt {R^{2}-\left( \frac {R}{2}\right)^{2}}= \frac { \sqrt {3}}{2}R$,  
therefore, the volume of the cone-shaped container without a lid (ignoring loss) is:  
$V= \frac {1}{3}\times S\times h= \frac {1}{3}\times \pi r^{2}\times h  
= \frac {1}{3}\times \pi \times \left( \frac {R}{2}\right)^{2}\times \frac { \sqrt {3}}{2}R  
= \boxed{\frac { \sqrt {3}}{24}\pi R^{3}}$.  
Hence, the correct answer is: A.  
This derivation shows that setting the base radius of the cone to $r= \frac {R}{2}$, slant height $l=R$, and height $h= \sqrt {R^{2}-\left( \frac {R}{2}\right)^{2}}= \frac { \sqrt {3}}{2}R$, allows us to calculate the volume of the cone-shaped container without a lid (ignoring loss).

Question: The comprehensive solar detection satellite ""Kua Fu I"" in our country is a space science satellite developed by the second phase of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Space Science Pilot Project. The satellite has the scientific goal of ""one magnetic field and two bursts"", that is, to simultaneously observe the solar magnetic field and the two most intense eruptive phenomena of the sun - solar flares and coronal mass ejections. In order to understand whether a certain interest group in a school is interested in the relevant knowledge of the ""Kua Fu I"" detection satellite, a survey was conducted on 100 students in the interest group. It is known that among the surveyed students, boys account for 55% of the survey population, of which 45 are interested, and the rest are not interested. Among the surveyed girls, 20 are interested, and the rest are not interested.

$(1)$ Please complete the $2\times 2$ contingency table, and based on the small probability value $\alpha =0.005$ of the independence test, can it be concluded that the interest in the knowledge related to the ""Kua Fu I"" detection satellite is associated with the gender of the students?

\hline
\text{Boys} & & & \\
\hline
\text{Girls} & & & \\
\hline
\text{Total} & & & \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

$(2)$ From the 100 people in the interest group, one person is randomly selected. Let $A$ represent the event ""the person selected is a boy,"" and $B$ represent the event ""the person selected is not interested in the knowledge related to 'Kua Fu I' detection satellite."" Find $P(B|A)$.

$(3)$ By randomly sampling 4 boys and 3 girls from the interested students, forming a sample of size 7, and then randomly selecting 3 people from the 7 selected, let the random variable $X$ represent the number of girls among the 3 people. Find the distribution table and mathematical expectation of $X$.

Given formula: ${\chi^2}=\frac{{n{{({ad-bc})}^2}}}{{({a+b})({c+d})({a+c})({b+d})}}$, where $n=a+b+c+d$.

Question: Read the material and solve the following problems: Dynamic number: a four-digit positive integer, with each digit not being $0$, combine the digit in the thousandth place and the hundredth place to form a two-digit number, and combine the digit in the tenth place and the unit place to form a two-digit number. If the two-digit number formed by the digit in the tenth place and the unit place is twice the two-digit number formed by the digit in the thousandth place and the hundredth place, then this four-digit positive integer is called a ""dynamic number."" For example, the four-digit number $2346$, the two-digit number formed by the digit in the thousandth place and the hundredth place is $23$, and the two-digit number formed by the digit in the tenth place and the unit place is $46$. Since $46=2\times 23$, $2346$ is a ""dynamic number."" We can use these two two-digit numbers to represent the ""dynamic number,"" such as $2346$ can be represented as: $23\times 100+46$.

<answer>

</answer>
","1. First, isolate $z$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $\left( 1+2i \right)$:
   $$z = \frac{1-i}{1+2i}$$
2. To simplify the complex fraction, multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is $\left( 1-2i \right)$:
   $$z = \frac{\left( 1-i \right)\left( 1-2i \right)}{\left( 1+2i \right)\left( 1-2i \right)}$$
3. Simplify the numerator and the denominator using the distributive property and the fact that $i^2 = -1$:
   $$z = \frac{1 - 2i - i + 2}{1 - 2i + 2i - 4\left( -1 \right)} = \frac{3 - 3i}{5}$$
4. Now, find $\overline{z}$ by changing the sign of the imaginary part of $z$:
   $$\overline{z} = \frac{3 + 3i}{5}$$
5. To find $\left| \overline{z} \right|$, compute the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts:
   $$\left| \overline{z} \right| = \sqrt{\left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{25} + \frac{9}{25}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{25}}$$
6. Finally, rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt{2}$:
   $$\left| \overline{z} \right| = \sqrt{\frac{18}{25} \times \frac{2}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{36}{50}} = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{10}}{5}}$$",train

(2) For triangle ABC, the sides $a$, $b$, $c$ are opposite to the angles $A$, $B$, $C$, respectively. Given $b=5$, and $$f\left( \frac {B}{2}\right)=1$$, find the maximum area of triangle ABC.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Solution:  
(1) Since $\cos2x=1-2\sin^2x$, and $\cos\left(2x- \frac {\pi}{3}\right)=\cos \frac {\pi}{3}\cos2x-\sin \frac {\pi}{3}\sin2x$  
$= \frac {1}{2}\cos2x- \frac { \sqrt {3}}{2}\sin2x$,  
thus $$f(x)=\cos2x-\left( \frac {1}{2}\cos2x- \frac { \sqrt {3}}{2}\sin2x\right)$$  
$= \frac {1}{2}\cos2x+ \frac { \sqrt {3}}{2}\sin2x$  
$=\sin\left(2x+ \frac {\pi}{6}\right)$,  
therefore, the smallest positive period of the function $f(x)$ is $$T= \frac {2\pi}{2}=\pi$$;  
(2) Since $f(x)=\sin\left(2x+ \frac {\pi}{6}\right)$, thus $$f\left( \frac {B}{2}\right)=\sin\left(B+ \frac {\pi}{6}\right)=1$$,  
and since $B\in(0,\pi)$, we can get $B+ \frac {\pi}{6}\in\left( \frac {\pi}{6}, \frac {7\pi}{6}\right)$,  
thus $B+ \frac {\pi}{6}= \frac {\pi}{2}$, which gives $B= \frac {\pi}{3}$.  
Therefore, according to the cosine rule, we have $$\cos B= \frac {a^{2}+c^{2}-b^{2}}{2ac}=\frac {1}{2}$$,  
rearranging gives: $a^{2}+c^{2}-ac=b^{2}=25$.  
Moreover, according to the basic inequality, we have $a^{2}+c^{2}\geq2ac$,  
thus $ac\leq a^{2}+c^{2}-ac=25$, equality holds if and only if $a=c$.  
Hence, the area of triangle ABC is $$S_{\triangle ABC}= \frac {1}{2}ac\cdot \sin B\leq \frac {25}{2}\cdot \frac { \sqrt {3}}{2}= \frac {25 \sqrt {3}}{4}$$,  
the maximum area of triangle ABC is when $a=c=5$, which is $\boxed{\frac {25 \sqrt {3}}{4}}$.",train

If $\overrightarrow {OP}= \overrightarrow {OM}+ \overrightarrow {ON}$, then the trajectory equation of point P is $\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ \frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=2$;  
If $\overrightarrow {OP}= 2\overrightarrow {OM}+ \overrightarrow {ON}$, then the trajectory equation of point P is $\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ \frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=5$;  
If $\overrightarrow {OP}= \overrightarrow {OM}+ 2\overrightarrow {ON}$, then the trajectory equation of point P is $\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ \frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=5$;  
If $\overrightarrow {OP}= 3\overrightarrow {OM}+ \overrightarrow {ON}$, then the trajectory equation of point P is $\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ \frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=10$;  
If $\overrightarrow {OP}= \overrightarrow {OM}+ 3\overrightarrow {ON}$, then the trajectory equation of point P is $\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ \frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=10$;  
Based on the above research results, it can be concluded that if $\overrightarrow {OP}= m\overrightarrow {OM}+ n\overrightarrow {ON}$ ($m，n∈N^{*}$), then the trajectory equation of point P is \_\_\_\_\_\_ .

","Solution: Since $2=1^{2}+1^{2}$, $5=1^{2}+2^{2}$, $10=1^{2}+3^{2}$...,  
when $\overrightarrow {OP}= m\overrightarrow {OM}+ n\overrightarrow {ON}$ ($m，n∈N^{*}$),  
the trajectory equation of point P is $\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ \frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=m^{2}+n^{2}$.  
Therefore, the answer is: $\boxed{\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ \frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=m^{2}+n^{2}}$.  
By carefully observing the given trajectory equations of point P, we can find that $2=1^{2}+1^{2}$, $5=1^{2}+2^{2}$, $10=1^{2}+3^{2}$..., it can be concluded that when $\overrightarrow {OP}= m\overrightarrow {OM}+ n\overrightarrow {ON}$ ($m，n∈N^{*}$), the trajectory equation of point P is $\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ \frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=m^{2}+n^{2}$.

Question: Given in the Cartesian coordinate system $xOy$, the parametric equation of curve $C$ is $\begin{cases} x=3+5\cos \alpha \\ y=4+5\sin \alpha \end{cases}$, ($\alpha$ is the parameter), points $A$ and $B$ are on curve $C$. With the origin $O$ as the pole and the positive half-axis of $x$ as the polar axis, the polar coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ are respectively $A(\rho_{1}, \frac{\pi}{6})$, $B(\rho_{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$  
(Ⅰ) Find the polar equation of curve $C$;  
(Ⅱ) Suppose the center of curve $C$ is $M$, find the area of $\triangle MAB$.

","Solution:  
(Ⅰ) From the parametric equation of curve $C$, $\begin{cases} x=3+5\cos \alpha \\ y=4+5\sin \alpha \end{cases}$, ($\alpha$ is the parameter), we get $(x-3)^{2}+(y-4)^{2}=25$, which is $x^{2}+y^{2}-6x-8y=0$. Therefore, the polar equation of curve $C$ is $\rho=6\cos \theta+8\sin \theta$;  
(Ⅱ) The polar coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ are respectively $A(\rho_{1}, \frac{\pi}{6})$, $B(\rho_{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$, which gives $A(4+3\sqrt{3}, \frac{\pi}{6})$, $B(8, \frac{\pi}{2})$,  
Therefore, $|AB|= \sqrt{(4+3\sqrt{3})^{2}+64-2(4+3\sqrt{3})\cdot 8\cdot \frac{1}{2}}=5\sqrt{3}$  
Suppose the center of curve $C$ is $M$, the distance from $M$ to $AB$ is $d= \sqrt{25-(\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{2})^{2}}= \frac{5}{2}$,  
Therefore, the area of $\triangle MAB$ is $S= \frac{1}{2}\times \frac{5}{2}\times 5\sqrt{3}= \boxed{\frac{25\sqrt{3}}{4}}$.",train

","From the problem, we know that each expression on the left side is an arithmetic mean, and each expression on the right side is a geometric mean. This means that the arithmetic mean of several numbers is not less than their geometric mean.  
By induction, we can infer that when \\(n\in\mathbb{N}^*(n\geqslant 2)\\), \\( \dfrac {a_{1}+a_{2}+…+a_{n}}{n}\geqslant \sqrt[n]{a_{1}a_{2}\cdots a_{n}}\\).  
Therefore, the answer is: $\boxed{\sqrt[n]{a_{1}a_{2}\cdots a_{n}}}$.  
From the problem, we know that each expression on the left side is an arithmetic mean, and each expression on the right side is a geometric mean, which means that the arithmetic mean of several numbers is not less than their geometric mean. This conclusion can be drawn.

(1) Find the range of values for $a$.  
(2) If $|f(x)-g(x)|\leq 1$ holds for all $x$ in the interval $[a+2, a+3]$, find the range of values for $a$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Solution:  
(1) For $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ to be defined, we need $$\begin{cases} x-3a>0 \\ x-a>0 \\ a>0\text{ and }a\neq 1\end{cases}$$,  
For $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ to be defined in the given interval $[a+2, a+3]$, it is equivalent to: $$\begin{cases} a+2>3a \\ a>0\text{ and }a\neq 1\end{cases}$$,  
Therefore, $0<a<1$.  
(2) For $|f(x)-g(x)|\leq 1$ to hold for all $x$ in the interval $[a+2, a+3]$, it is equivalent to $|\log_{a}(x-3a)(x-a)|\leq 1$,  
which means $a\leq (x-2a)^2-a^2\leq \frac{1}{a}$ for any $x\in [a+2, a+3]$ always holds.  
Let $h(x)=(x-2a)^2-a^2$, $x\in [a+2, a+3]$,  
and its axis of symmetry $x=2a<2$ is to the left of the interval $[a+2, a+3]$,  
$\Leftrightarrow$ $$\begin{cases} a\leq h(a+2) \\ \frac{1}{a}\geq h(a+3)\end{cases}$$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $$\begin{cases} a\leq 4-4a \\ \frac{1}{a}\geq 9-6a\end{cases}$$, therefore, $0<a\leq \boxed{\frac{9-\sqrt{57}}{12}}$.",train

Question: In the polar coordinate system, it is known that curve $C_{1}$: $\rho=2\cos \theta$. By shifting the points on curve $C_{1}$ one unit to the left and then doubling the x-coordinate while keeping the y-coordinate unchanged, we obtain curve $C$. It is also known that line $l$: $\begin{cases} x= \sqrt {2}+t\cos \dfrac {π}{4} \\ y=t\sin \dfrac {π}{4}\end{cases}$ (where $t$ is a parameter), and line $l$ intersects curve $C$ at points $A$ and $B$.  
$(1)$ Find the rectangular coordinate equation of curve $C$ and explain what kind of curve it is;  
$(2)$ Given point $P(\sqrt {2},0)$, find $|PA|+|PB|$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Solution:  
$(1)$ The rectangular coordinate equation of curve $C_{1}$ is: $x^{2}+y^{2}-2x=0$, which can be rewritten as $(x-1)^{2}+y^{2}=1$.  
Therefore, the equation of curve $C$ is $\dfrac {x^{2}}{4}+y^{2}=1$.  
Thus, curve $C$ represents an ellipse with foci at $(-\sqrt {3},0)$ and $(\sqrt {3},0)$, and a major axis length of $4$.  
$(2)$ Substituting the parametric equation of line $l$ into the equation of curve $C$: $\dfrac {x^{2}}{4}+y^{2}=1$, we get $\dfrac {5}{2}t^{2}+2t-2=0$.  
Let the parameters corresponding to points $A$ and $B$ be $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$ respectively.  
Then $t_{1}+t_{2}=-\dfrac {4}{5}$, and $t_{1}t_{2}=-\dfrac {4}{5}$.  
Therefore, $|PA|+|PB|=|t_{1}|+|t_{2}|=|t_{1}-t_{2}|= \dfrac {4\sqrt {6}}{5}$.  
So, the final answers are:  
$(1)$ The equation of curve $C$ is $\boxed{\dfrac {x^{2}}{4}+y^{2}=1}$, and it is an ellipse.  
$(2)$ The sum of the distances $|PA|+|PB|$ is $\boxed{\dfrac {4\sqrt {6}}{5}}$.",train

","(II) Since $f(A)=\sin (2A+ \dfrac {π}{6})+ \dfrac {1}{2}=1$, we have $\sin (2A+ \dfrac {π}{6})= \dfrac {1}{2}$.
Given $0 < A < π$, we have $\dfrac {π}{6} < 2A+ \dfrac {π}{6} < \dfrac {13π}{6}$, which leads to $2A+ \dfrac {π}{6}= \dfrac {5π}{6}$, and thus $A= \dfrac {π}{3}$.
By the cosine rule, we have: $a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}-2bc\cos A=(b+c)^{2}-2bc-2bc\cos A$.
Substituting the given conditions, we obtain: $1=4-3bc$, and hence $bc=1$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

","Proof: (3) From (2), we know that the function $f(x)=1-\frac{1}{x}-\ln x$ is monotonically increasing on the interval $(0,1)$,
And monotonically decreasing on the interval $(1,+\infty)$,
So the maximum value of the function $f(x)$ on the interval $(0,+\infty)$ is $f(1)=0$, that is, $f(x)\leqslant 0$.
So we have $1-\frac{1}{x}-\ln x\leqslant 0$ is always true,
So $1-\ln x\leqslant \frac{1}{x}$,
So $2-\ln x\leqslant 1+\frac{1}{x}$, that is, $\ln e^{2}-\ln x\leqslant \frac{1+x}{x}$,
That is, $\boxed{\ln \frac{e^{2}}{x}\leqslant \frac{1+x}{x}}$.",train

","Since point F(3, 0) is one of the foci of the hyperbola $3x^2-my^2=3m$ ($m>0$),

thus, we get $a=\sqrt{6}$, $c=3$.  
The eccentricity of the hyperbola is: $\frac{3}{\sqrt{6}}=\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}$.  
The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}}$.

If either $p$ or $q$ is true, and both $p$ and $q$ are false, find the range of the real number $a$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>

</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Since either $p$ or $q$ is true, it means at least one of $p$ and $q$ is a true statement; and since both $p$ and $q$ are false, it means at least one of $p$ and $q$ is a false statement;  
$\therefore$ Among $p$ and $q$, one is a false statement, and the other is a true statement;  
The complex number $\frac{a+i}{1+i}= \frac{a+1}{2}+ \frac{1-a}{2}i$;  
$\therefore$ If $p$ is true and $q$ is false, then:  
(1) When $p$ is true: $(4a-3)^2-1 > 0$, solving this yields $a > 1$ or $a < \frac{1}{2}$;  
(2) When $q$ is false: $\frac{a+1}{2}\leqslant 0$ or $\frac{1-a}{2}\leqslant 0$, solving this yields $a\leqslant -1$, or $a\geqslant 1$;  
$\therefore$ The range of $a$ is: $(-\infty,-1]\cup(1,+\infty)$.  
If $p$ is false and $q$ is true, then:  
(1) When $p$ is false: $(4a-3)^2-1\leqslant 0$, solving this yields $\frac{1}{2}\leqslant a\leqslant 1$;  
(2) When $q$ is true: $\begin{cases} \frac{a+1}{2} > 0 \\ \frac{1-a}{2} > 0\end{cases}$, solving this yields $-1 < a < 1$;  
$\therefore$ The range of $a$ is: $\left[\frac{1}{2},1\right)$.

With the implementation of the ice and snow sports strategy of ""expanding to the south, west, and east,"" ice and snow sports are no longer limited to some traditional ice and snow provinces and cities. In order to understand the participation of citizens in ice and snow sports, a certain survey center randomly selected 100 people from City $A$ and City $B$ each to investigate whether these people have participated in ice and snow sports. The $2\times 2$ contingency table obtained is as follows:

Question: Given that the graph of the function $f(x)$ is symmetric to the graph of the function $g(x) = \log_{2}{x}$ with respect to the line $y=x$, find $f\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Since the graph of the function $f(x)$ is symmetric to the graph of the function $g(x) = \log_{2}{x}$ with respect to the line $y=x$, it follows that the function $f(x)$ and the function $g(x) = \log_{2}{x}$ are inverse functions of each other.
Therefore, 
$$ f(x) = 2^{x} $$
Applying this to find the value of $f\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)$ we get:
$$ f\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2^{-\frac{1}{2}} $$
Now let's solve the right-hand side:
$$ 2^{-\frac{1}{2}} = \left(2^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^{-1} = \left(\sqrt{2}\right)^{-1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} $$
Multiplying numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{2}$ to rationalize the denominator, we obtain:
$$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} $$
So we have arrived at our final answer:
$$ \boxed{f\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} $$",train

(2) If the trajectory from (1) intersects circle M at points R and S, find the maximum value of the area of $\triangle MRS$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","(1) (Science) Let P be $(x, y)$. Since $\overrightarrow {AB}=\lambda \overrightarrow {AC}$ and $\overrightarrow {BP}=\lambda \overrightarrow {PC}$, we have $x_B=\lambda x_C$ and $x-x_B=\lambda(x_C-x)$.  
Therefore, $$\frac {x-x_{B}}{x_{C}-x}= \frac {x_{B}}{x_{C}}$$,  
which leads to $$x= \frac {2x_{B}x_{C}}{x_{B}+x_{C}}$$ (1).  
Let the equation of the line passing through A be $y=kx+a$ (clearly, $k$ exists).  
From $$\begin{cases} y=kx+a \\ (x-2)^{2}+y^{2}=1\end{cases}$$, we get $(1+k^2)x^2+(2ak-4)x+a^2+3=0$.  
Thus, $$x_{B}+x_{C}= \frac {4-2ak}{1+k^{2}}$$ and $$x_{B}x_{C}= \frac {a^2+3}{1+k^{2}}$$.  
Substituting into (1), we get $$x= \frac {a^{2}+3}{2-ak}$$,  
and therefore $$y=kx+a= \frac {2a+3k}{2-ak}$$.  
Eliminating $k$, we find the trajectory to be $2x-ay-3=0$ (inside circle M).  
(Arts) Let P be $(x, y)$. Since the reciprocals of the x-coordinates of points B, P, and C form an arithmetic sequence,  
we have $$\frac {2}{x}= \frac {1}{x_{B}}+ \frac {1}{x_{C}} \Rightarrow x= \frac {2x_{B}x_{C}}{x_{B}+x_{C}}$$ (the rest follows similarly).  
(2) The trajectory is a line passing through the fixed point $\left(\frac {3}{2}, 0\right)$ inside circle M.  
From $$\begin{cases} 2x-ay-3=0 \\ (x-2)^{2}+y^{2}=1\end{cases}$$, we get $(a^2+4)y^2-2ay-3=0$.  
Thus, $$|y_{1}-y_{2}|= \sqrt {(y_{1}+y_{2})^{2}-4y_{1}y_{2}}=4 \sqrt { \frac {a^{2}+3}{(a^{2}+4)^{2}}}$$  
Therefore, $$S_{\triangle MRS}= \frac {1}{2} \times \frac {1}{2} \times 4 \sqrt { \frac {a^{2}+3}{(a^{2}+4)^{2}}} = \sqrt { \frac {a^{2}+3}{(a^{2}+4)^{2}}} = \sqrt { \frac {1}{(a^{2}+3)+ \frac {1}{(a^{2}+3)}+2}}$$  
Let $t=a^2+3$, then $t \geq 3$, and the function $f(t)=t+ \frac {1}{t}$ is increasing for $t \geq 3$,  
Therefore, $$S_{\triangle MRS} \leq \sqrt { \frac {1}{3+ \frac {1}{3}+2}}= \frac { \sqrt {3}}{4}$$．  
Thus, $$\boxed{S_{\triangle MRS}|_{\max}= \frac { \sqrt {3}}{4}}$$, which occurs when $t=3$, $a=0$.",train

$$
\sin 420^{\circ} = \sin (360^{\circ} + 60^{\circ}).
$$
Now we apply the periodic property of the sine function:
$$
\sin (360^{\circ} + 60^{\circ}) = \sin 60^{\circ}.
$$
The value of $\sin 60^{\circ}$ is a special triangle value, which is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

Question: Given the ellipse $$\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ \frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1(a＞b＞0)$$ intersects the positive x-axis and y-axis at points A and B, respectively. The distance from the origin O to the line AB is $$\frac {2 \sqrt {5}}{5}$$, and the eccentricity of the ellipse is $$\frac { \sqrt {3}}{2}$$.  
(1) Find the equation of the ellipse;  
(2) Determine whether there exists a line $l$ passing through point $$P(0， \frac {5}{3})$$ that intersects the ellipse at two distinct points M and N, such that $$\overrightarrow {PM}=2 \overrightarrow {PN}$$ holds. If such a line exists, find its equation; if not, explain why.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Solution:  
(1) From the given information, the equation of line AB can be written as $$\frac {x}{a}+ \frac {y}{b}=1$$, which simplifies to bx+ay-ab=0.  
Since the distance from the origin O to the line AB is $$\frac {2 \sqrt {5}}{5}$$, we have $$\frac {|ab|}{ \sqrt {a^{2}+b^{2}}}= \frac {2 \sqrt {5}}{5}$$. Also, given $$\frac {c}{a}= \frac { \sqrt {3}}{2}$$,  
by solving the system of equations $$\begin{cases} \frac {ab}{ \sqrt {a^{2}+b^{2}}}= \frac {2 \sqrt {5}}{5} \\ \frac {c}{a}= \frac { \sqrt {3}}{2} \\ a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}\end{cases}$$, we get $$\begin{cases} a=2b=2 \\ c= \sqrt {3}\end{cases}$$,  
Therefore, the equation of the ellipse is $$\boxed{\frac {x^{2}}{4}+y^{2}=1}$$;  
(2) When the slope of line $l$ is undefined, M(0, -1), N(0, 1), which does not satisfy $$\overrightarrow {PM}=2 \overrightarrow {PN}$$, discard this case.  
When the slope of line $l$ exists, let $y=kx+ \frac {5}{3}$, combining $$\begin{cases} y=kx+ \frac {5}{3} \\ \frac {x^{2}}{4}+y^{2}=1\end{cases}$$, it simplifies to (9+36k<sup>2</sup>)x<sup>2</sup>+120kx+64=0,  
Since line $l$ intersects the ellipse at two points, we have $\Delta＞0$, which simplifies to $$k^{2}＞ \frac {4}{9}$$. Let M($x_{1}$, $y_{1}$), N($x_{2}$, $y_{2}$), then $$x_{1}+x_{2}= \frac {-40k}{3+12k^{2}}$$, $$x_{1}x_{2}= \frac {64}{9+36k^{2}}$$.  
If $$\overrightarrow {PM}=2 \overrightarrow {PN}$$, then $x_{1}=2x_{2}$. By solving $$\begin{cases} x_{1}+x_{2}= \frac {-40k}{3+12k^{2}} \\ x_{1}x_{2}= \frac {64}{9+36k^{2}} \\ x_{1}=2x_{2}\end{cases}$$, we find $k^{2}= \frac {9}{14}$$＞ \frac {4}{9}$.  
Thus, $k=± \frac {3 \sqrt {14}}{14}$.  
In conclusion, the equation of the sought line $l$ is $$\boxed{y=± \frac {3 \sqrt {14}}{14}x+ \frac {5}{3}}$$.",train

","(III) We have $c\_n = \frac{a\_n}{b\_n} = \frac{n+2}{3} \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^{n-1}$. The sum of the first $n$ terms for the sequence $\{c\_n\}$ is given by: $T\_n = \frac{1}{3} [3 \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^0 + 4 \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^1 + \dots + (n+2) \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^{n-1}]$. Multiplying both sides by $\frac{1}{2}$, we get $\frac{1}{2}T\_n = \frac{1}{3} [3 \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^1 + 4 \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^2 + \dots + (n+1) \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^{n-1} + (n+2) \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^n]$. Subtracting the two equations, we have: $\frac{1}{2}T\_n = \frac{1}{3} [3 + (\frac{1}{2})^1 + (\frac{1}{2})^2 + \dots + (\frac{1}{2})^{n-1} - (n+2) \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^n] = \frac{1}{3} [4 - (\frac{1}{2})^{n-1} - (n+2) \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^n]$.

Question: Given that the sequence $\{a_n\}$ is an arithmetic sequence, $a_1=t^2-t$, $a_2=4$, $a_3=t^2+t$.

$(1)$ Find the general formula for the sequence $\{a_n\}$;  
$(2)$ If the sequence $\{a_n\}$ is increasing and the sequence $\{b_n\}$ satisfies $\log_2 b_n=a_n$, find the sum of the first $n$ terms $S_n$ of the sequence $\{(a_n-1)b_n\}$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Solution:  
$(1)$ Since $\{a_n\}$ is an arithmetic sequence, $a_1=t^2-t$, $a_2=4$, $a_3=t^2+t$.  
Then: $2a_2=a_1+a_3$,  
So: $t^2+t+t^2-t=8$,  
Solving this, we get: $t=\pm2$.  
① When $t=2$, $a_1=2$, and the common difference $d=2$,  
So: $a_n=2n$.  
② When $t=-2$, $a_1=6$, and the common difference $d=-2$,  
So: $a_n=8-2n$.  
$(2)$ Since the sequence $\{a_n\}$ is increasing,  
Then: $a_n=2n$.  
The sequence $\{b_n\}$ satisfies $\log_2 b_n=a_n$,  
Then: $b_n=4^n$.  
Then: $(a_n-1)b_n=(2n-1)\cdot4^n$  
So: $S_n=1\cdot4^1+3\cdot4^2+\ldots+(2n-1)\cdot4^n①$,  
$4S_n=1\cdot4^2+3\cdot4^3+\ldots+(2n-1)\cdot4^{n+1}②$.  
Subtracting ② from ①, we get: $-3S_n=4+2\cdot4^2+2\cdot4^3+\ldots+2\cdot4^n-(2n-1)\cdot4^{n+1}$,  
$=4+2\cdot \frac{4^2(1-4^{n-1})}{-3}-(2n-1)\cdot4^{n+1}$.  
Therefore: $S_n= \frac{(6n-5)\cdot 4^{n+1}+20}{9}$.  
So, the final answers are:  
$(1)$ $a_n=2n$ or $a_n=8-2n$  
$(2)$ $S_n= \boxed{\frac{(6n-5)\cdot 4^{n+1}+20}{9}}$",train

Question: Given $M= \frac {a^{2}-a\sin \theta+1}{a^{2}-a\cos \theta +1}$ ($a,\theta \in \mathbb{R}, a\neq 0$), the range of $M$ is \_\_\_\_\_\_.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","To solve, we transform $M= \frac {a^{2}-a\sin \theta+1}{a^{2}-a\cos \theta +1}$ into $aM\cos \theta-a\sin \theta-(M-1)(a^{2}+1)=0$,  
which implies that the line $aMx-ay-(M-1)(a^{2}+1)=0$ has common points with the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}=1$,  
thus $\frac {|M-1|(a^{2}+1)}{|a| \sqrt {M^{2}+1}}\leqslant 1$, leading to $\frac {|M-1|}{ \sqrt {M^{2}+1}}\leqslant \frac {|a|}{a^{2}+1}\leqslant \frac {1}{2}$ (equality holds when $|a|=1$).  
Therefore, $3M^{2}-8M+3\leqslant 0$.  
Solving this, we get: $\frac {4- \sqrt {7}}{3}\leqslant M\leqslant \frac {4+ \sqrt {7}}{3}$.  
Thus, the range of $M$ is $\boxed{\left[ \frac {4- \sqrt {7}}{3}, \frac {4+ \sqrt {7}}{3}\right]}$.  
Transforming $M= \frac {a^{2}-a\sin \theta+1}{a^{2}-a\cos \theta +1}$ into $aM\cos \theta-a\sin \theta-(M-1)(a^{2}+1)=0$, we find that the line $aMx-ay-(M-1)(a^{2}+1)=0$ has common points with the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}=1$, which implies $\frac {|M-1|(a^{2}+1)}{|a| \sqrt {M^{2}+1}}\leqslant 1$, leading to $\frac {|M-1|}{ \sqrt {M^{2}+1}}\leqslant \frac {|a|}{a^{2}+1}\leqslant \frac {1}{2}$, and then solving the inequality for $M$.

Question: In recent days, a company has launched a promotional campaign for one of their products. It was calculated that the sales volume $P$ (in units of 10,000 pieces) and the promotional expenses $x$ (in units of 10,000 RMB) satisfy the function relationship: 
$$P = 3 - \frac{2}{x+1} \quad (0 \leq x \leq a, \text{ where } a \text{ is a positive constant}).$$

It is known that when the production quantity of this product is $P$ (in units of 10,000 pieces), an additional cost of $10 + 2P$ (in units of 10,000 RMB) (excluding promotional expenses) will be needed, and the sales price of the product is set as $(4 + \frac{30}{P})$ RMB/piece, assuming that the production volume is equal to the sales volume.

(Ⅰ) Express the profit $y$ (in units of 10,000 RMB) of this product as a function of the promotional expenses $x$ (in units of 10,000 RMB).

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<answer>

</answer>
","Let $A(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $B(x_{2},y_{2})$. Then, the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are the solutions to the system of equations $\begin{cases} ax^{2}+by^{2}=1 \\ x+y-1=0 \end{cases}$.  
From $ax_{1}^{2}+by_{1}^{2}=1$ and $ax_{2}^{2}+by_{2}^{2}=1$, subtracting the two equations gives  
$a(x_{1}+x_{2})(x_{1}-x_{2})+b(y_{1}+y_{2})(y_{1}-y_{2})=0$,  
Since $\dfrac {y_{1}-y_{2}}{x_{1}-x_{2}}=-1$,  
$\therefore \dfrac {y_{1}+y_{2}}{x_{1}+x_{2}}= \dfrac {a}{b}$,  
which implies $\dfrac {2y_{c}}{2x_{c}}= \dfrac {a}{b}$, thus $\dfrac {y_{c}}{x_{c}}= \dfrac {a}{b}= \dfrac { \sqrt {2}}{2}$, leading to $b= \sqrt {2}a$ $(1)$.  
Eliminating $y$ from the system of equations gives $(a+b)x^{2}-2bx+b-1=0$,  
From $x_{1}+x_{2}= \dfrac {2b}{a+b}$ and $x_{1}+x_{2}= \dfrac {b-1}{a+b}$,  
Given $|AB|= \sqrt {1+k^{2}}\cdot \sqrt {(x_{1}+x_{2})^{2}-4x_{1}x_{2}}=2 \sqrt {2}$,  
we get $(x_{1}+x_{2})^{2}-4x_{1}x_{2}=4$, i.e., $( \dfrac {2b}{a+b})^{2}-4\cdot \dfrac {b-1}{a+b}=4$ $(2)$.  
Solving $(1)$ and $(2)$ gives $a= \dfrac {1}{3}$ and $b= \dfrac { \sqrt {2}}{3}$,  
Therefore, the equation of the ellipse is $\dfrac {x^{2}}{3}+ \dfrac { \sqrt {2}y^{2}}{3}=1$.  
The equation of the ellipse is $\boxed{\dfrac {x^{2}}{3}+ \dfrac { \sqrt {2}y^{2}}{3}=1}$.",train

Question: In triangle $ABC$, with internal angles $A$, $B$, and $C$, and opposite sides $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively, it is known that $\dfrac{a}{\cos C \sin B} = \dfrac{b}{\sin B} + \dfrac{c}{\cos C}$.
$(1)$ Find angle $B$;
$(2)$ If $b = \sqrt{2}$, find the maximum area of $\triangle ABC$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","$(2)$ Based on the conclusion from $(1)$, $B = \dfrac{\pi}{4}$.
Applying the Cosine Law we have, $b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac \cos B$. Substituting $b = \sqrt{2}$ and $\cos B = \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, we get
$2 = a^2 + c^2 - \sqrt{2}ac$,
which rearranges to $2 + \sqrt{2} ac = a^2 + c^2$.
Since $a^2 + c^2 \geq 2ac$, we have $2 + \sqrt{2} ac \geq 2ac$,
leading to $ac \leq \dfrac{2}{2 - \sqrt{2}} = 2 + \sqrt{2}$ after rationalizing the denominator.
Using this inequality for the area of the triangle, $S = \dfrac{1}{2}ac \sin B = \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{4}ac \leq \dfrac{\sqrt{2} + 1}{2}$.
Therefore, the maximum area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\boxed{\dfrac{\sqrt{2} + 1}{2}}$.",train

Question: Let the function $f(x)= \sqrt {3}\sin x\cos x+\cos ^{2}x+a$

$(2)$ When $x\in\left[- \dfrac {\pi}{6}, \dfrac {\pi}{3}\right]$, the sum of the maximum and minimum values of the function $f(x)$ is $\dfrac {3}{2}$. Find the solution set for the inequality $f(x) > 1$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Solution:  
$(1)$ The function $f(x)= \sqrt {3}\sin x\cos x+\cos ^{2}x+a$  
$= \dfrac { \sqrt {3}}{2}\sin 2x+ \dfrac {1+\cos 2x}{2}+a$  
$=\sin \left(2x+ \dfrac {\pi}{6}\right)+ \dfrac {1}{2}+a$;  
$\therefore$ The smallest positive period of the function $f(x)$ is $T= \dfrac {2\pi}{\omega }=\pi$;  
Let $2k\pi+ \dfrac {\pi}{2}\leqslant 2x+ \dfrac {\pi}{6}\leqslant 2k\pi+ \dfrac {3\pi}{2}$, $k\in\mathbb{Z}$,  
Solving gives $k\pi+ \dfrac {\pi}{6}\leqslant x\leqslant k\pi+ \dfrac {2\pi}{3}$, $k\in\mathbb{Z}$,  
$\therefore$ The interval where the function $f(x)$ is monotonically decreasing is:  
$\left[k\pi+ \dfrac {\pi}{6},k\pi+ \dfrac {2\pi}{3}\right]$, $k\in\mathbb{Z}$; $(6$ points$)$  
$(2)$ Given $x\in\left[- \dfrac {\pi}{6}, \dfrac {\pi}{3}\right]$, we have: $- \dfrac {\pi}{6}\leqslant 2x+ \dfrac {\pi}{6}\leqslant \dfrac {5\pi}{6}$,  
$\therefore f(x)=\sin \left(2x+ \dfrac {\pi}{6}\right)$ has a maximum value of $1+ \dfrac {1}{2}+a= \dfrac {3}{2}+a$; $(8$ points$)$  
The minimum value is $- \dfrac {1}{2}+ \dfrac {1}{2}+a=a$; $(9$ points$)$  
$\therefore \dfrac {3}{2}+a+a= \dfrac {3}{2}$, solving gives $a=0$;  
$\therefore$ The inequality $f(x) > 1$ becomes $\sin \left(2x+ \dfrac {\pi}{6}\right) > \dfrac {1}{2}$,  
$\therefore 2k\pi+ \dfrac {\pi}{6} < 2x+ \dfrac {\pi}{6} < 2k\pi+ \dfrac {5\pi}{6}$, $k\in\mathbb{Z}$;  
$k\pi < x < k\pi+ \dfrac {\pi}{3}$, $k\in\mathbb{Z}$; $(11$ points$)$  
Given $x\in\left[- \dfrac {\pi}{6}, \dfrac {\pi}{3}\right]$,  
$\therefore$ The solution set for the inequality $f(x) > 1$ is $\boxed{\{x|0 < x < \dfrac {\pi}{3}\}}$. $(12$ points$)$",train

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<answer>
...
</answer>
","From the given information, we have:
$$
\frac{a^2}{c} - c = a
$$
Rearranging, we get:
$$
a^2 - c^2 - ac = 0
$$
Since $e = \frac{c}{a}$, we can substitute $c = ae$ into the equation:
$$
a^2 - (ae)^2 - a^2e = 0
$$
Simplifying, we obtain the quadratic equation for $e$:
$$
e^2 + e - 1 = 0
$$
Solving this equation, we find two possible values for $e$:
$$
e = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \quad \text{(rejected)} \quad \text{or} \quad e = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}
$$
Since eccentricity cannot be negative, we accept the latter solution:
$$

","(IV) Since $f(x)=x^{2}-a\ln x$, then $g(x)=f(x)-2x=x^{2}-a\ln x-2x$.
The function $g'(x)=2x-\frac{a}{x}-2=\frac{2x^{2}-2x-a}{x}$. $g(x)$ has two extreme points $x_{1}$, $x_{2}(x_{1} < x_{2})$ in $\left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}\right]$,
We can get: $2x^{2}-2x-a=0$ has two unequal real roots in $\left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}\right]$, $\triangle=4+8a > 0$, at this time $a > -\frac{1}{2}$.
And, $2\times\frac{1}{16}-2\times\frac{1}{4}-a > 0$, $2\times\frac{9}{16}-2\times\frac{3}{4}-a > 0$, solving: $a < -\frac{3}{8}$, in summary, $a\in(-\frac{1}{2},-\frac{3}{8})$.
$x_{1}=\frac{2-\sqrt{4+8a}}{4}=\frac{1-\sqrt{1+2a}}{2}$, $x_{2}=\frac{1+\sqrt{1+2a}}{2}$,

Question: Given the function $f(x)=(a-1)\ln x+ax^{2}+1$.  
$(1)$ Discuss the monotonicity of the function $f(x)$.  
$(2)$ If for any $x_{1} > x_{2} > 0$, it always holds that $\dfrac {f(x_{1})-f(x_{2})}{x_{1}-x_{2}}\geqslant 2$, find the range of values for $a$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Solution:  
$(1)$ The domain of $f(x)$ is $(0,+\infty)$,  
$f'(x)= \dfrac {a-1}{x}+2ax= \dfrac {2ax^{2}+a-1}{x}$,  
When $a\geqslant 1$, $f'(x) > 0$, hence $f(x)$ is increasing on $(0,+\infty)$;  
When $a\leqslant 0$, $f'(x) < 0$, hence $f(x)$ is decreasing on $(0,+\infty)$;  
When $0 < a < 1$, let $f'(x)=0$, solving gives $x= \sqrt { \dfrac {1-a}{2a}}$.  
Then when $x\in(0, \sqrt { \dfrac {1-a}{2a}})$, $f'(x) > 0$; when $x\in( \sqrt { \dfrac {1-a}{2a}},+\infty)$, $f'(x) < 0$.  
Therefore, $f(x)$ is increasing on $(0, \sqrt { \dfrac {1-a}{2a}})$ and decreasing on $( \sqrt { \dfrac {1-a}{2a}},+\infty)$.  
$(2)$ For any $x_{1} > x_{2} > 0$, it always holds that $\dfrac {f(x_{1})-f(x_{2})}{x_{1}-x_{2}}\geqslant 2$,  
which is equivalent to for any $x_{1} > x_{2} > 0$, $f(x_{1})-2x_{1}\geqslant f(x_{2})-2x_{2}$  
Let $g(x)=f(x)-2x$, then $g'(x)= \dfrac {a-1}{x}+2ax-2$,  
This is equivalent to $g(x)$ being increasing on $(0,+\infty)$, i.e., $ \dfrac {a-1}{x}+2ax-2\geqslant 0$.  
Thus, $a\geqslant \dfrac {2x+1}{2x^{2}+1}$ always holds on $(0,+\infty)$,  
Let $h(x)= \dfrac {2x+1}{2x^{2}+1}$, $h'(x)= \dfrac {-4x^{2}-4x+2}{(2x^{2}+1)^{2}}$,  
Let $h'(x) > 0$, solving gives: $0 < x < \dfrac { \sqrt {3}-1}{2}$, let $h'(x) < 0$, solving gives: $x > \dfrac { \sqrt {3}-1}{2}$,  
Therefore, $h(x)$ is increasing on $(0, \dfrac { \sqrt {3}-1}{2})$ and decreasing on $( \dfrac { \sqrt {3}-1}{2},+\infty)$,  
Therefore, $h(x)_{max}=h( \dfrac { \sqrt {3}-1}{2})= \dfrac { \sqrt {3}+1}{2}$,  
Thus, the range of values for $a$ is: $\boxed{\left[ \dfrac { \sqrt {3}+1}{2},+\infty\right)}$.",train

<answer>

","A  
The equation of the asymptote of the hyperbola can be expressed as $\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$. Since the asymptote passes through the point (4, 2), we have $\frac{4^2}{a^2} - \frac{2^2}{b^2} = 1$. Given that the eccentricity $e = \sqrt{1 + \frac{b^2}{a^2}}$, and the asymptote's equation implies $\frac{b^2}{a^2} = \frac{3}{4}$, we find $e = \sqrt{1 + \frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{7}{4}}$. Therefore, the eccentricity of the hyperbola is $\boxed{\sqrt{\frac{7}{4}}}$.",train

","(1) Since $A= \frac {\pi}{6}$ and $B$ is an obtuse angle,  
from $a=b\tan A \Rightarrow \frac {\sin A}{\cos A} = \frac {a}{b} = \frac {\sin A}{\sin B} \Rightarrow \cos A = \sin B \Rightarrow \sin B = \frac {\sqrt {3}}{2} \Rightarrow B = \frac {2\pi}{3}$.  
(2) From $\cos A = \sin B \Rightarrow B-A = \frac {\pi}{2} \Rightarrow A \in (0, \frac {\pi}{4})$.  
Also, $A+B+C=\pi$  
Therefore, $\sin A + \sin C = \sin A + \sin(\pi-A-B) = \sin A + \sin( \frac {\pi}{2}-2A) = \sin A + \cos 2A$

</answer>
","In $\triangle ABC$, since $\tan B= -\frac{4}{3}$, it follows that $\sin B= \frac{4}{5}$ and $\cos B= -\frac{3}{5}$.  
Given that the area $S= \frac{1}{2}ac\sin B=2c=8$, it follows that $c=4$.  
Therefore, $b= \sqrt{a^{2}+c^{2}-2ac\cos B}= \sqrt{65}$.  
Thus, $\frac{a+b+c}{\sin A+\sin B+\sin C}= \frac{b}{\sin B}= \frac{5\sqrt{65}}{4}$.  
Hence, the answer is $\boxed{\frac{5\sqrt{65}}{4}}$.  
This solution involves finding $\sin B$, using the area formula of a triangle to find the length of $c$, further using the cosine rule to find the length of $b$, and then applying the sine rule and the property of proportionality to obtain the result.

Question: Suppose point $P$ is on the parabola $y^2=x$, and point $Q$ is on the circle $(x-3)^2+y^2=1$, then the minimum value of $|PQ|$ is $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\}.$

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","From the problem, we know that the parabola and the circle do not intersect, and the center of the circle is $A(3,0)$. Therefore, $|PQ|\geqslant |PA|-|AQ|=|PA|-1$. The equality holds if and only if points $P$, $Q$, and $A$ are collinear. So, when $|PA|$ takes the minimum value, $|PQ|$ is the smallest.
Let $P(x_0, y_0)$, then $y_0^2=x_0$, and $|PA|=\sqrt{(x_0 -3)^2 +y^{2}_0}=\sqrt{x^{2}_0-6x_0 +9+x_0 }=\sqrt{\left(x_0 - \frac{5}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{11}{4}}$.
It's clear that $|PA|$ takes the minimum value $\frac{\sqrt{11}}{2}$ if and only if $x_0=\frac{5}{2}$. At this time, $|PQ|$ takes the minimum value $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{11}}{2}-1}$.",train

We call $y=\left[x\right]$, $x\in R$ the floor function, also known as the Gaussian function. It is also humorously referred to as the ""floor function"" by some math enthusiasts. As early as the 18th century, the great mathematician and leader of the Göttingen school, Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss, first mentioned it, hence the name ""Gaussian function."" In real life, this ""truncating and rounding down"" Gaussian function has a wide range of applications, such as parking fees, Excel spreadsheets, and in mathematical analysis, it appears in various problems such as differentiation, limits, definite integrals, series, and so on.

Since 0 < A < π, we have $\sin(A) = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2(A)} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{9}} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}$.
Therefore, $\sin(A + \frac{\pi}{4}) = \sin(A) \cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) + \cos(A) \sin(\frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (-\frac{1}{3}) \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \boxed{\frac{4 - \sqrt{2}}{6}}$.",train

Question: Given an ellipse with its equation $\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ \frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1$ (where $a>b>0$) and center at O, one of its vertices is (0, 1), and its eccentricity is $\frac { \sqrt {2}}{2}$. A line passing through its right focus intersects the ellipse at points A and B.  
(1) Find the equation of this ellipse;  
(2) If OA is perpendicular to OB, find the area of triangle OAB.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","(2) The right focus of the ellipse is at (1, 0). When the line AB is perpendicular to the x-axis, the coordinates of A and B are $(1, \frac { \sqrt {2}}{2})$ and $(1, -\frac { \sqrt {2}}{2})$, respectively.  
At this time, the product of the slopes of OA and OB, $k_{OA} \times k_{OB} = -\frac {1}{2} \neq -1$, so the line AB is not perpendicular to the x-axis.  
Let the slope of line AB be $k$, then the equation of line AB is $y=k(x-1)$.  
Solving this together with $\frac {x^{2}}{2}+ \frac {y^{2}}{1}=1$ gives $(2k^{2}+1)x^{2}-4k^{2}x+2k^{2}-2=0$.  
Let A be $(x_{1}, y_{1})$ and B be $(x_{2}, y_{2})$, and let the midpoint of AB be M $(x_{0}, y_{0})$.  
Thus, $x_{1}+x_{2}= \frac {4k^{2}}{2k^{2}+1}$, $x_{1}x_{2}= \frac {2(k^{2}-1)}{2k^{2}+1}$, and $M( \frac {2k^{2}}{2k^{2}+1}, \frac {-k}{2k^{2}+1})$.  
Since OA is perpendicular to OB, $k_{OA} \times k_{OB} = 0$, thus $x_{1}x_{2}+y_{1}y_{2}=0$.  
Therefore, $x_{1}x_{2}+k(x_{1}-1)k(x_{2}-1)=(k^{2}+1)x_{1}x_{2}-k^{2}(x_{1}+x_{2})+k^{2}=0$.  
Thus, $\frac {2(k^{2}+1)(k^{2}-1)}{2k^{2}+1}- \frac {4k^{4}}{2k^{2}+1}+k^{2}=0$, which leads to $k^{2}=2$ and hence $k= \pm \sqrt {2}$.  
Therefore, $|AB|^{2}=4|OM|^{2}=\frac {72}{25}$, so $|AB|= \frac {6 \sqrt {2}}{5}$.  
The height of the right triangle OAB from the hypotenuse to point O, which is the distance d to line AB, is $d= \frac {|k|}{ \sqrt {k^{2}+1}}= \frac { \sqrt {2}}{ \sqrt {3}}$.  
Therefore, the area of triangle OAB is $\boxed{\frac {2 \sqrt {3}}{5}}$.",train

Question: Given an ellipse $C$: $\dfrac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} + \dfrac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1 (a > b > 0)$ with eccentricity $\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$, and a line $l$: $y = x + 2$ is tangent to a circle $O$ centered at the origin with the semi-minor axis of the ellipse as its radius.  
(I) Find the equation of the ellipse $C$;  
(II) Suppose the ellipse $C$ intersects the curve $|y| = kx (k > 0)$ at points $A$ and $B$, find the maximum area of $\triangle OAB$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Solution:  
(I) From the given information, the equation of circle $O$ is $x^{2} + y^{2} = b^{2}$,  
Since the line $l$: $x - y + 2 = 0$ is tangent to circle $O$, we have $\dfrac{|2|}{\sqrt{1^{2} + (-1)^{2}}} = b$,  
Thus, $b = \sqrt{2}$. Given $e = \dfrac{c}{a} = \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$,  
We have $a^{2} = 3c^{2} = 3(a^{2} - b^{2})$,  
Solving this gives $a^{2} = 3$,  
Therefore, the equation of ellipse $C$ is $\dfrac{x^{2}}{3} + \dfrac{y^{2}}{2} = 1$.  
(II) Let point $A(x_{0}, y_{0})$ ($x_{0} > 0, y_{0} > 0$), then $y_{0} = kx_{0}$,  
Let $AB$ intersect the $x$-axis at point $D$, by symmetry:  
$S_{\triangle OAB} = 2S_{\triangle OAD} = 2 \times \dfrac{1}{2}x_{0}y_{0} = kx_{0}^{2}$,  
From $\begin{cases} y_{0} = kx_{0} \\ \dfrac{x_{0}^{2}}{3} + \dfrac{y_{0}^{2}}{2} = 1 \end{cases}$, we get $x_{0}^{2} = \dfrac{6}{2 + 3k^{2}}$,  
Thus, $S_{\triangle OAB} = k \cdot \dfrac{6}{2 + 3k^{2}} = \dfrac{6}{\dfrac{2}{k} + 3k} \leqslant \dfrac{6}{2\sqrt{\dfrac{2}{k} \cdot 3k}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{6}}{2}$,  
Equality holds if and only if $\dfrac{2}{k} = 3k$, that is, $k = \dfrac{\sqrt{6}}{2}$,  
Therefore, the maximum area of $\triangle OAB$ is $\boxed{\dfrac{\sqrt{6}}{2}}$.",train

Question: (Geometry Proof Exercise) From a point A outside a circle ⊙O with radius 2, draw a line intersecting ⊙O at points C and D. A line segment AB is tangent to ⊙O at B. Given that AC=4 and AB=$4 \sqrt {2}$, find $tan∠DAB$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Since the circle ⊙O has a radius of 2, and given AC=4, AB=$4 \sqrt {2}$,  
by the Tangent-Secant Theorem, we have $AB^2=AC \cdot AD$  
Therefore, $32=4 \cdot AD$  
Thus, $AD=8$  
Hence, $CD=4$,  
which means CD is the diameter.  
Draw a perpendicular from O to AB, with the foot at B,  
Therefore, $$tan∠DAB=tan∠OAB= \frac {2}{4 \sqrt {2}}= \frac { \sqrt {2}}{4}$$  
So, the answer is: $\boxed{\frac { \sqrt {2}}{4}}$  
By applying the Tangent-Secant Theorem, we can determine the length of CD, and knowing the radius of ⊙O is 2, we can deduce that CD is the diameter of the circle. Using the property of tangents, by drawing a perpendicular from O to AB with the foot at B, we can solve the triangle to find the answer.  
This problem tests the knowledge of the Tangent-Secant Theorem, where using the theorem to find the length of CD and deducing that CD is the diameter of the circle is key to solving the problem.",train

<answer>

</answer>
","Since in $\triangle ABC$, $B=\frac{2\pi}{3}$, $c=5$, and $b=7$,
Using the cosine rule, we have $b^{2}=a^{2}+c^{2}-2bc\cos B$, which gives us $7^{2}=5^{2}+a^{2}-2\times 5a\times \cos \frac{2\pi}{3}=25+a^{2}-10a\times (-\frac{1}{2})=25+a^{2}+5a$.
Rearranging, we get: $a^{2}+5a-24=0$.
Solving for $a$, we obtain $a=3$ (we discard the negative value).
Then, using the formula for the area of a triangle, $S=\frac{1}{2}ac\sin B=\frac{1}{2}\times 5\times 3\times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}=\boxed{\frac{15\sqrt{3}}{4}}$.",train

Question: Given a parabola $y^{2}=2px(p > 0)$ with a point $M(1,m)$ on it, the distance from $M$ to its focus is $5$. The left vertex of the hyperbola $C: x^{2}-\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1 (b > 0)$ is $A$, and if one of the asymptotes of the hyperbola $C$ is perpendicular to the line $AM$, then its eccentricity is __________.

<answer>

</answer>
","Since the left vertex of the hyperbola $x^{2}- \frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} =1$ is $A(-1,0)$,  
the slope of line $AM$ is $k= \frac{4-0}{1-(-1)}=2$,  
according to the problem, $- \frac{b}{a}\times2=-1$,  
$\therefore \frac{b}{a}= \frac{1}{2}$,  
$\therefore$ the eccentricity of the hyperbola is $e= \frac{c}{a}= \sqrt{1+\left( \frac{b}{a}\right)^{2}}= \frac{ \sqrt{5}}{2}$,  
thus, the answer is $\boxed{\frac{ \sqrt{5}}{2}}$.",train

Answer the question and return in the following format:

</answer>
","1. When $x \geq 0$, the original inequality can be simplified to $x(x-1) \geq 0$.  
Solving this gives $x \geq 1$ or $x \leq 0$.  
Therefore, the solution set of the original inequality is $\{x | x \geq 1 \text{ or } x = 0\}$.  
2. When $x < 0$, the original inequality can be simplified to $-x(x-1) \geq 0$.  
Solving this gives $0 \leq x \leq 1$.  
Therefore, the solution set of the original inequality is $\{x | x = 0\}$.  
Combining the above, the solution set of the original inequality is $\{x | x \geq 1 \text{ or } x = 0\}$.

Question: A certain company carried out a salary reform, using work efficiency as an important criterion for determining salary levels, greatly improving the enthusiasm of employees. However, this also caused dissatisfaction among some senior employees. In order to investigate the relationship between salary and seniority of employees, the Human Resources Department randomly selected $16$ employees from the company's technical research and development department to understand the situation. The results are as follows:

| Seniority (years) | $1$ | $2$ | $3$ | $4$ | $5$ | $6$ | $7$ | $8$ | $9$ | $10$ | $11$ | $12$ | $13$ | $14$ | $15$ | $16$ |
|-------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Annual Salary (in 10,000s) | $9.95$ | $10.12$ | $9.96$ | $9.96$ | $10.01$ | $9.92$ | $9.98$ | $10.04$ | $10.26$ | $9.91$ | $10.13$ | $10.02$ | $9.22$ | $10.04$ | $10.05$ | $9.95$ |

After calculation, it was found that $\overline{x}=\frac{1}{16}\sum_{i=1}^{16}{x_i}=9.97$, $s=\sqrt{\frac{1}{16}\sum_{i=1}^{16}{(x_i-\overline{x})^2}}\approx0.212$, $\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{16}{(i-8.5)^2}}\approx18.439$, and $\sum_{i=1}^{16}{(x_i-\overline{x})(i-8.5)}=-2.78$, where $x_i$ represents the annual salary for a seniority of $i$ years, $i=1,2,\ldots,16$.

$(1)$ Calculate the correlation coefficient $r$ between the annual salary $x_i$ and seniority $i$ $(i=1,2,\ldots,16)$, and determine whether it can be considered that the annual salary and seniority have a linear relationship (if $|r|<0.25$, it can be considered that the annual salary and seniority do not have a linear relationship).

$(2)$ Among the $16$ employees selected, if the annual salary is within $(\overline{x}-3s,\overline{x}+3s)$, the salary reform will continue, and corresponding subsidies will be given to each senior employee. If an employee's annual salary is outside $(\overline{x}-3s,\overline{x}+3s)$, the employee will be interviewed by the Human Resources Department for job adjustment, and the mean and standard deviation of the annual salaries of the remaining employees among the originally selected $16$ employees need to be recalculated (rounded to $0.01$).

Given: The correlation coefficient $r$ of the sample $(x_i,y_i)$ $(i=1,2,\ldots,16)$ is $r=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n{(x_i-\overline{x})(y_i-\overline{y})}}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n{(x_i-\overline{x})^2}}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n{(y_i-\overline{y})^2}}}$, $\sqrt{0.008}\approx0.09$, $0.212^2+9.97^2\approx99.446$, $15\times10.02=1506.006$, and $9.22^2\approx85.008$.

","To solve this, if $F(x) = f(x) - kx - 3k$ has three zeros within its domain,  
it means that $y = f(x)$ and $y = k(x + 3)$ have three intersection points.  
The distance $d$ from the center of the semicircle $(1, 0)$ to the line $y = k(x + 3)$ is $d = \frac{|4k|}{\sqrt{k^{2} + 1}} = 1$,  
solving this gives: $k = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{15}$,  
thus: $0 < k < \frac{\sqrt{15}}{15}$;  
Therefore, the answer is: $\boxed{(0, \frac{\sqrt{15}}{15})}$.  
The problem is transformed into finding the range of $k$ such that $f(x)$ and $y = kx + 3k$ have three intersection points.

Question: In the Cartesian coordinate plane, a polar coordinate system is established with the origin as the pole and the non-negative half of the x-axis as the polar axis. It is known that point A has polar coordinates $$( \sqrt{2}, \frac{\pi}{4})$$, and the parametric equation of line $l$ is:
$$\begin{cases} x= \frac{3}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}t \\ y= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}t \end{cases}$$ (where $t$ is the parameter), and point A lies on line $l$.
(Ⅰ) Find the corresponding parameter $t$ of point A;
(Ⅱ) If the parametric equation of curve C is:
$$\begin{cases} x=2\cos\theta \\ y=\sin\theta \end{cases}$$ (where $\theta$ is the parameter), and line $l$ intersects curve C at points M and N, find the length of line segment |MN|.

","(Ⅱ) To eliminate parameter $\theta$ and find the standard equation of curve C, we get:
$$\frac{x^{2}}{4} +y^{2} =1.$$
Similarly, we can derive the standard equation of line $l$:
$$y=2-x.$$
By combining the two equations, we obtain:
$$5x^{2}-16x+12=0.$$
Let the coordinates of points M and N be $(x_{1}, y_{1})$ and $(x_{2}, y_{2})$ respectively. By Vieta's formulas, we have:
$$x_{1}+x_{2}=\frac{16}{5},$$
$$x_{1}x_{2}=\frac{12}{5}.$$
Using the formula of the length of a chord, we compute $|MN|$ as:
$$|MN|= \sqrt{(1+1^{2})\left[\left(\frac{16}{5}\right)^{2} - 4\times \frac{12}{5}\right]} = \boxed{\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{5}}.$$",validation

<answer>

</answer>
","Since the complex number $z$ satisfies the equation $\frac{z+i}{-2i^{3}-z}=i$, we can rewrite it as $z+i=-2-zi$. Solving for $z$, we get:
$$z= \frac {-2-i}{1+i}= \frac {-(2+i)(1-i)}{(1+i)(1-i)}=- \frac {3}{2}+ \frac {1}{2}i.$$
Taking the conjugate of $z$, we have:
$$\overset{ .}{z}=- \frac {3}{2}- \frac {1}{2}i.$$
Now, we can find the value of $| \overset{ .}{z}+1|$ as follows:
$$| \overset{ .}{z}+1|=|- \frac {1}{2}+ \frac {1}{2}i|= \sqrt {(- \frac {1}{2})^{2}+( \frac {1}{2})^{2}}= \frac {\sqrt {2}}{2}.$$
Therefore, the correct answer is option B: $\boxed{\frac {\sqrt {2}}{2}}$.",validation

Question: Given the parabola $y^{2}=6x$, a chord $P_{1}P_{2}$ is drawn through the point $P(4,1)$ such that it is bisected by $P$. Find the equation of the line containing this chord and the length $|P_{1}P_{2}|$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Let $(x,y)$ be any point on the line, and let the endpoints of the chord be $P_{1}(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $P_{2}(x_{2},y_{2})$.
Since $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ lie on the parabola, we have $y _{1}^{2}=6x_{1}$ and $y _{2}^{2}=6x_{2}$.
Subtracting these two equations gives $(y_{1}+y_{2})(y_{1}-y_{2})=6(x_{1}-x_{2})$.
Since the chord is bisected by $P(4,1)$, we have $y_{1}+y_{2}=2$.
Thus, the slope of the line is $k= \frac{6}{y_{1}+y_{2}}=3$.
Therefore, the equation of the line is $y-1=3(x-4)$, which simplifies to $3x-y-11=0$.
Substituting $y=3x-11$ into the parabola equation $y^{2}=6x$ gives $(3x-11)^{2}=6x$, which simplifies to $y^{2}-2y-22=0$.
Hence, $y_{1}+y_{2}=2$ and $y_{1} \cdot y_{2}=-22$.
Thus, $|P_{1}P_{2}|= \sqrt {1+ \frac{1}{9}}\cdot \sqrt {4+88}= \boxed{\frac{2 \sqrt {230}}{3}}$.",validation

","1. Since the circle passes through point A $(0, p)$ and its center C is on the parabola $x^2=2py$, the radius of the circle can be expressed as $r=CP=\sqrt{OC^2+OP^2}=\sqrt{y^2+p^2}$.
2. The circle intersects the x-axis at points M and N, so the length of MN, which is the chord of the circle perpendicular to the y-axis, is $2r=2\sqrt{y^2+p^2}$.
3. The projection of MN on the y-axis is the diameter of the circle, which is $2r$. Therefore, the triangle MCN is a right-angled isosceles triangle.
4. In a right-angled isosceles triangle, the sine of the angle between the equal sides is $\sin\angle MCN=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.

Question: Given the function $f(x)= \frac {ax+1}{x+2}$ is increasing on the interval $(-2,+\infty)$, the range of the real number $a$ is __________.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Since $f(x)= \frac {ax+1}{x+2}=a+ \frac {1-2a}{x+2}$, by considering the monotonicity of composite functions,  
and given that $f(x)$ is increasing on $(-2,+\infty)$, it follows that $g(x)= \frac {1-2a}{x+2}$ is increasing on $(-2,+\infty)$,  
thus $1-2a < 0$, solving this yields $a > \frac {1}{2}$,  
therefore, the answer is: $\boxed{\{a|a > \frac {1}{2}\}}$.  
By separating the constant in the expression of $f(x)$ and turning it into the sum of a constant and another function $g(x)$, and deducing $1-2a < 0$ from the fact that $g(x)$ is increasing on $(-2,+\infty)$, we obtain the range of the real number $a$.  
This problem tests the ability to determine the range of a parameter using the monotonicity of a function, and is considered a basic question.",validation

2. Let $\triangle ABC$ be an acute triangle with side $a = \sqrt{19}$ opposite to angle $A$ and side $b = 5$ opposite to angle $B$. If $f(A) = 0$, find the area of $\triangle ABC$.

","2. Given $\triangle ABC$ is an acute triangle with side $a = \sqrt{19}$ opposite to angle $A$ and side $b = 5$ opposite to angle $B$. If $f(A) = 0$, then $\cos 2A + \frac{1}{2} = 0$. Solving this equation gives $2A = \frac{2}{3}\pi$, which simplifies to $A = \frac{1}{3}\pi$. Using the cosine rule, we have $a^{2} = b^{2} + c^{2} - 2bc \cos A$. Substituting the given values, we get $c^{2} - 5c + 6 = 0$. Solving this quadratic equation gives $c = 2$ or $c = 3$. If $c = 2$, then $\cos B = \frac{19 + 4 - 25}{2 \times \sqrt{19} \times 2} < 0$, which implies that $B$ is an obtuse angle. This contradicts the fact that $\triangle ABC$ is an acute triangle. Therefore, $c = 3$. The area of $\triangle ABC$ is given by $S = \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 3 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \boxed{\frac{15\sqrt{3}}{4}}$.",validation

","(2) Given the general term from (1), we know: $b_n = c^{a_n} = c^{2n - 1}$.  
If $c = 1$, then $b_n = 1$, hence $S_n = n$.  
If $c \neq 1$, since $\frac{b_{n+1}}{b_n} = c^{a_{n+1} - a_n} = c^2$, the sequence $\{b_n\}$ is a geometric sequence with the first term $b_1 = c$ and common ratio $c^2$.  
Therefore, the sum of the first $n$ terms of $\{b_n\}$ is given by  
\[
S_n = \frac{c(1 - c^{2n})}{1 - c^2}.

","(2) Connect $OP$. Since $Q$ is the tangent point, $PQ \perpendicular OQ$, by Pythagoras' theorem, we have $|PQ|^2=|OP|^2-|OQ|^2$.
It is also given that $|PQ|=|PA|$, hence $|PQ|^2=|PA|^2$.
Therefore: $(a^2+b^2)-1^2=(a-2)^2+(b-1)^2$,
simplifying we get the relation between real numbers $a$ and $b$: $2a+b-3=0$, so $b=-2a+3$.
Subsequently, $|PQ|= \sqrt{a^2+b^2-1}= \sqrt{a^2+(-2a+3)^2-1}= \sqrt{5a^2-12a+8}= \sqrt{5 \left(a- \frac{6}{5} \right)^2+ \frac{4}{5}}$.

","(1) From the given equation $$a=b\cos C+\sqrt{3}c\sin B$$ and the law of sines, we have:
$$\sin A=\sin B\cos C+\sqrt{3}\sin C\sin B.\quad\quad(1)$$
Also, since $A=\pi-(B+C)$, we have:
$$\sin A=\sin(B+C)=\sin B\cos C+\cos B\sin C.\quad\quad(2)$$
Comparing equations (1) and (2), and considering that $C\in(0,\pi)$, we obtain:
$$\sqrt{3}\sin B=\cos B,\quad\text{or}\quad\tan B=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}.$$
Since $B\in(0,\pi)$, we find that:
$$B=\frac{\pi}{6}.$$
(2) The area of triangle ABC is given by:
$$S=\frac{1}{2}ac\sin B=\frac{1}{4}ac.$$
Using the given condition and the law of cosines, we have:
$$1=a^2+c^2-2ac\cos\frac{\pi}{6}=a^2+c^2-\sqrt{3}ac.$$
Since $a^2+c^2\geq 2ac$, we get:
$$ac\leq\frac{1}{2-\sqrt{3}}=2+\sqrt{3},$$
with equality holding if and only if $a=c$.

Question: Two people, A and B, are simultaneously calculating a polynomial multiplication problem: $\left(2x+a\right)\cdot \left(3x+b\right)$. A copied the sign of $a$ incorrectly in the first polynomial, writing $+a$ as $-a$, and obtained the result $6x^{2}+11x-10$. B missed the coefficient of $x$ in the second polynomial, writing $3x$ as $x$, and obtained the result $2x^{2}-9x+10$. Calculate the correct result of this polynomial multiplication problem.

(I) Find the monotonic intervals of $f(x)$ on $\left[-\frac{\pi}{2}, 0\right]$;
(II) If $f(x_{0}) = \frac{3}{5}$, and $x_{0} \in \left[0, \frac{\pi}{3}\right]$, find the value of $\sin 2x_{0}$.

","(II) Since $f(x_{0}) = \frac{3}{5}$ and $x_{0} \in \left[0, \frac{\pi}{3}\right]$, we have:
$$\cos\left(2x_{0} + \frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{3}{5}$$
And, $2x_{0} + \frac{\pi}{6} \in \left[\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{5\pi}{6}\right]$, which implies:
$$\sin\left(2x_{0} + \frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{4}{5}$$
Now, we find $\sin 2x_{0}$ as follows:
$$\sin 2x_{0} = \cos\left(\left(2x_{0} + \frac{\pi}{6}\right) - \frac{\pi}{6}\right)$$
$$=\sin\left(2x_{0} + \frac{\pi}{6}\right)\cos\frac{\pi}{6} - \cos\left(2x_{0} + \frac{\pi}{6}\right)\sin\frac{\pi}{6}$$

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>

</think>

<answer>

</answer>
","1. We have $f(x) = -f'(0)e^{x} + 2x$. Differentiate both sides with respect to $x$, we get:
$$f'(x) = -f'(0)e^{x} + 2$$
2. Find $f'(0)$ by substituting $x = 0$ into the equation above:
$$f'(0) = -f'(0)e^{0} + 2$$
Solving for $f'(0)$, we get $f'(0) = 1$.
3. Substitute $f'(0)$ back into the original function to get $f(x) = -e^{x} + 2x$.
4. Find $f(0)$ by substituting $x = 0$ into the function: $f(0) = -e^{0} + 0 = -1$.
5. The tangent line $l$ is given by $y = x - 1$.
6. The derivative of $y = e^{x}$ is $y' = e^{x}$.
7. For the shortest distance between the tangent line $l$ and the line passing through point $Q$, these lines must be parallel. Therefore, we set $e^{x} = 1$ and solve for $x$ to get $x = 0$.
8. The coordinates of point $Q$ are $Q(0, 1)$.
9. Using the formula for the distance between a point and a line, we have:
$$\text{distance} = \frac{|Ax + By + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} = \frac{|(1)(0) - 1(1) + 1|}{\sqrt{(1)^2 + (-1)^2}} = \boxed{\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}}$$",validation

Question: Definition: If the solution of a linear equation is also the solution of a system of linear inequalities, then the linear equation is called the ""companion equation"" of the inequality system. For example, the solution of the equation $2x-6=0$ is $x=3$. The solution set of the inequality system $\left\{\begin{array}{l}x-2>0\\ x<5\end{array}\right.$ is $2 < x < 5$ because $2 < 3 < 5$. Therefore, the equation $2x-6=0$ is called the ""companion equation"" of the inequality system $\left\{\begin{array}{l}x-2>0\\ x<5\end{array}\right.$.

Question: Given the function $\sin x=x- \frac{x^{3}}{3!}+ \frac{x^{5}}{5!}- \frac{x^{7}}{7!}+…+(-1)^{n-1} \frac{x^{2n-1}}{(2n-1)!}+…$, which has infinite roots due to $\sin x=0$; $(0,\pm \pi ,\pm 2\pi ,\pm 3\pi ,\cdots )$. It can be deduced that: $\sin x=x\left( 1-\frac{x^{2}}{\pi ^{2}} \right)\left( 1-\frac{x^{2}}{4\pi ^{2}} \right)\left( 1-\frac{x^{2}}{9\pi ^{2}} \right)\ldots $. Upon expanding the right side of this equation, we find that the coefficient of $-x^{3}$ is $\frac{1}{\pi ^{2}}+\frac{1}{(2\pi )^{2}}+\frac{1}{(3\pi )^{2}}+… =\frac{1}{3!}$,

i.e., $\frac{1}{1^{2}}+\frac{1}{(2 )^{2}}+\frac{1}{(3 )^{2}}+… =\frac{\pi ^{2}}{6}$. Now, use the function $\cos x=1- \frac{x^{2}}{2!}+ \frac{x^{4}}{4!}- \frac{x^{6}}{6!}+…+(-1)^{n-1} \frac{x^{2\left(n-1\right)}}{2\left(n-1\right)!}$ to derive a similar conclusion.

","First, we utilize the terminal side of angle $\alpha$ to find the value of $\tan \alpha$.

Finally, by applying the fundamental relationships among trigonometric functions for the same angle, we find the value of $\sin \alpha$. This problem primarily assesses the application of basic relationships among trigonometric functions of the same angle. The key to solving this problem is to determine the correct quadrant for $\alpha$ to establish the correct sign for $\sin \alpha$.",validation

Question: Ancient Chinese literature ""The Four Elements of Jade"" records the problem of ""how many beams to buy"": ""Six guan two hundred and ten qian, send someone to buy how many beams. Each beam costs three wen for transportation, and if there is no money, it is equivalent to one beam."" The gist of it is: Now please buy a batch of beams on behalf of someone, and the price of this batch of beams is 6210 wen. If the transportation cost for each beam is 3 wen, then after taking one less beam, the remaining beams' transportation cost is exactly equal to the price of one beam. According to the problem, the equation can be written as $3x(x-1)=6210$, where $x$ represents ( ).

Question: Given a sequence $\{a_n\}$ whose sum of the first $n$ terms is $S_n$, for any positive integer $n$, it holds that $S_n = \frac{3}{2}a_n + n - 3$.  
(I) Prove that $\{a_n - 1\}$ is a geometric sequence;  
(II) Find the sum of the first $n$ terms $T_n$ of the sequence $\{na_n\}$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","(I) Proof: Since for any positive integer $n$, it holds that $S_n = \frac{3}{2}a_n + n - 3$,  
when $n=1$, we have $a_1 = S_1 = \frac{3}{2}a_1 - 2$, solving this gives $a_1 = 4$.  
For $n \geq 2$, we have $a_n = S_n - S_{n-1} = \frac{3}{2}a_n + n - 3 - (\frac{3}{2}a_{n-1} + n - 4)$, simplifying to $a_n = 3a_{n-1} - 2$,  
which can be transformed into $a_n - 1 = 3(a_{n-1} - 1)$,  
thus, $\{a_n - 1\}$ is a geometric sequence with the first term being 3 and the common ratio being 3.  
(II) Solution: From (I), we have $a_n - 1 = 3^n$, therefore $a_n = 3^n + 1$, hence $na_n = n \cdot 3^n + n$.  
Thus, the sum of the first $n$ terms $T_n$ of the sequence $\{na_n\}$ is $3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 3 \cdot 3^3 + \ldots + n \cdot 3^n + \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.  
Let $A_n = 3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 3 \cdot 3^3 + \ldots + n \cdot 3^n$,  
then $3A_n = 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^3 + \ldots + (n-1) \cdot 3^n + n \cdot 3^{n+1}$,  
thus, $-2A_n = 3 + 3^2 + \ldots + 3^n - n \cdot 3^{n+1} = \frac{3(3^n - 1)}{3 - 1} - n \cdot 3^{n+1}$,  
we get $A_n = \frac{3}{4} + \frac{(2n-1) \cdot 3^{n+1}}{4}$,  
therefore, the sum of the first $n$ terms $T_n$ of the sequence $\{na_n\}$ is $\boxed{\frac{3}{4} + \frac{(2n-1) \cdot 3^{n+1}}{4} + \frac{n(n+1)}{2}}$.",validation

Question: Elective 4-4: Coordinate System and Parametric Equations

In the Cartesian coordinate system $xOy$, the parametric equation of line $l$ is $\begin{cases} & x=t-1, \\ & y=t+2, \\ \end{cases}(t$ is the parameter$).$ In the polar coordinate system with the origin $O$ as the pole and the positive half-axis of $x$ as the polar axis, the polar equation of curve $C$ is $\rho =\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{1+2\cos^2\theta }}.$

(Ⅰ) Directly write out the Cartesian equations of line $l$ and curve $C$;

(Ⅱ) Let the distance from a point on curve $C$ to line $l$ be $d$, find the range of $d$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Solution:  
(Ⅰ) Since $\begin{cases} x=t-1 \\ y=t+2\end{cases}(t$ is the parameter$),$ we have $x-y=-3$, which means the Cartesian equation of line $l$ is $x-y+3=0.$  
Since $\rho= \dfrac { \sqrt {3}}{ \sqrt {1+2\cos ^{2}\theta}}$, we have $\rho^{2}= \dfrac {3}{1+2\cos ^{2}\theta}$, which means $\rho^{2}+2\rho^{2}\cos ^{2}\theta=3.$  
Therefore, the Cartesian equation of curve $C$ is $3x^{2}+y^{2}=3$, or $x^{2}+ \dfrac {y^{2}}{3}=1$;  
(Ⅱ) The parametric equation of curve $C$ is $\begin{cases} x=\cos \alpha \\ y= \sqrt {3}\sin \alpha\end{cases}(\alpha$ is the parameter$),$  
thus, the distance $d$ from a point on curve $C$ to line $l$ is $d= \dfrac {|\cos \alpha- \sqrt {3}\sin \alpha+3|}{ \sqrt {2}}= \dfrac {|2\cos (\alpha+ \dfrac {\pi}{3})+3|}{ \sqrt {2}}.$  
Therefore, when $\cos (\alpha+ \dfrac {\pi}{3})=1$, $d$ reaches its maximum value $\dfrac {5}{ \sqrt {2}}= \dfrac {5 \sqrt {2}}{2}$,  
and when $\cos (\alpha+ \dfrac {\pi}{3})=-1$, $d$ reaches its minimum value $\dfrac {1}{ \sqrt {2}}= \dfrac { \sqrt {2}}{2}$, thus the range of $d$ is $\boxed{\left[ \dfrac { \sqrt {2}}{2}, \dfrac {5 \sqrt {2}}{2}\right]}.$",validation

(Ⅱ) In triangle $ABC$, where the sides opposite angles $A$, $B$, $C$ are $a$, $b$, $c$ respectively, if $f(A)=\frac{3}{2}$ and $b+c=2$, find the minimum value of the real number $a$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>

</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","(Ⅱ) Given that $f(A)=\frac{3}{2}$, we have
$$
\sin(2A+\frac{\pi}{6})+1 = \frac{3}{2}.
$$
This simplifies to
$$
\sin(2A+\frac{\pi}{6}) = \frac{1}{2}.
$$
Since $A \in (0, \pi)$, then $2A+\frac{\pi}{6} \in \left(\frac{\pi}{6},\frac{13\pi}{6}\right)$, which leads to
$$
2A+\frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{5\pi}{6},
$$
and therefore
$$
A = \frac{\pi}{3}.
$$
By the cosine rule in triangle $ABC$, we have
$$
a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\cos\frac{\pi}{3} = (b+c)^2 - 3bc.
$$
With $b+c=2$, we know that $bc \leqslant \left(\frac{b+c}{2}\right)^2=1$, and thus $a^2 \geqslant 1$.
Therefore, the minimum value of the real number $a$ is achieved when $b = c = 1$, giving
$$

Question: In the sequence $\{a_n\}$, it is known that $a_1 = 1$, and for $n \geq 2$, $a_n = \frac {1}{3}a_{n-1} + \frac {2}{3^{n-1}} - \frac {2}{3}$. The sequence $\{b_n\}$ is defined such that $b_n = 3^{n-1}(a_n + 1)$.

(1) Prove that the sequence $\{b_n\}$ is an arithmetic sequence;
(2) Compute the sum of the first $n$ terms of the sequence $\{a_n\}$, denoted $S_n$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","From (1), we know that $b_n = 2 + (n - 1) \cdot 2 = 2n$,
so
$$3^{n-1}(a_n + 1) = 2n \Rightarrow a_n = \frac {2n}{3^{n-1}} - 1.$$
Let us consider
$$T_n = \frac {2}{1} + \frac {4}{3} + \frac {6}{3^2} + \ldots + \frac {2n}{3^{n-1}},$$
then
$$\frac {1}{3}T_n = \frac {2}{3} + \frac {4}{3^2} + \ldots + \frac {2(n-1)}{3^{n-1}} + \frac {2n}{3^n}.$$
Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us
$$\frac {2}{3}T_n = 2 \left(1 + \frac {1}{3} + \frac {1}{3^2} + \ldots + \frac {1}{3^{n-1}} \right) - \frac {2n}{3^n}$$
$$= \frac {2 \left(1 - \left(\frac {1}{3}\right)^n\right)}{1 - \frac {1}{3}} - \frac {2n}{3^n} = 3 - \frac {2n + 3}{3^n}.$$
Therefore,
$$T_n = \frac {9}{2} - \frac {2n + 3}{2 \cdot 3^{n-1}}.$$
Finally, the sum of the first $n$ terms of the sequence $\{a_n\}$ is
$$S_n = T_n - n = \frac {9}{2} - \frac {2n + 3}{2 \cdot 3^{n-1}} - n.$$
\[
\boxed{S_n = \frac {9}{2} - \frac {2n + 3}{2 \cdot 3^{n-1}} - n}

The perpendicular bisector of segment $AB$ intersects the $x$-axis at point $P$. The range of the $x$-coordinate of point $P$ is $\left(-\frac{1}{4}, 0\right)$.

","$(2)$ According to the problem, a line $l$ passing through point $F_1$ and not perpendicular to the coordinate axes intersects the ellipse at points $A$ and $B$, which means the slope of line $AB$ exists.
Let the equation of line $AB$ be $y = k(x + 1)$,
solving it together with $\frac{x^2}{2} + y^2 = 1$, we get $(1 + 2k^2)x^2 + 4k^2x + 2k^2 - 2 = 0$.
Let $A(x_1, y_1)$, $B(x_2, y_2)$, and the midpoint of $AB$ be $M(x_0, y_0)$,
we have $x_1 + x_2 = -\frac{4k^2}{1 + 2k^2}$, $x_1 \cdot x_2 = \frac{2k^2}{1 + 2k^2}$,
$y_1 + y_2 = k(x_1 + 1) + k(x_2 + 1) = \frac{2k}{1 + 2k^2}$,
thus $M\left(-\frac{2k^2}{1 + 2k^2}, \frac{k}{1 + 2k^2}\right)$.
Let the equation of the perpendicular bisector of $AB$ be $y - \frac{k}{1 + 2k^2} = -\frac{1}{k}\left(x + \frac{2k^2 - 2}{1 + 2k^2}\right)$,
setting $y = 0$, we get $x_p = \frac{-k^2}{1 + 2k^2}$.
Since $x_p \in \left(-\frac{1}{4}, 0\right)$, we have $0 < k^2 < \frac{1}{2}$. The length of $AB$ is $\sqrt{(1 + k^2)\left[(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1 \cdot x_2\right]} = \sqrt{(1 + k^2)\left[\left(-\frac{4k^2}{1 + 2k^2}\right)^2 - 4\frac{2k^2 - 2}{1 + 2k^2}\right]}$
$= \frac{2\sqrt{2} \cdot (1 + k^2)}{1 + 2k^2} = \sqrt{2}\left(1 + \frac{1}{1 + 2k^2}\right) \in \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}, 2\sqrt{2}\right)$;
thus, the range of the length of segment $AB$ is $\boxed{\left(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}, 2\sqrt{2}\right)}$.",validation

(Ⅰ) If the graph of the function $f(x)$ is symmetric about the line $x= \frac{\pi}{6}$, and $\omega\in[0,3]$ when, find the intervals of increase for the function $f(x)$.  
(Ⅱ) Under the condition of (Ⅰ), when $x\in[0, \frac{7\pi}{12}]$, the function $f(x)$ has exactly one zero point, find the range of the real number $b$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Solution:  
(Ⅰ) Given vectors $\overrightarrow{m}=(\sqrt{3}\sin \omega x,1)$, $\overrightarrow{n}=(\cos \omega x,{\cos }^{2}\omega x+1)$, the function $f(x)= \overrightarrow{m}\cdot \overrightarrow{n}+b$.  
Thus, $f(x)= \overrightarrow{m}\cdot \overrightarrow{n}+b= \sqrt{3}\sin \omega x\cos \omega x+{\cos }^{2}\omega x+1+b= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\sin 2\omega x+ \frac{1}{2}\cos 2\omega x+ \frac{3}{2}+b=\sin (2\omega x+ \frac{\pi}{6})+ \frac{3}{2}+b$.  
Since the graph of $f(x)$ is symmetric about the line $x= \frac{\pi}{6}$,  
then $2\omega\cdot \frac{\pi}{6}+ \frac{\pi}{6}=k\pi+ \frac{\pi}{2}(k\in\mathbb{Z})$,  
solving this gives $\omega=3k+1(k\in\mathbb{Z})$,  
since $\omega\in[0,3]$,  
then $\omega=1$,  
thus $f(x)=\sin (2x+ \frac{\pi}{6})+ \frac{3}{2}+b$,  
from $2k\pi- \frac{\pi}{2}\leqslant 2x+ \frac{\pi}{6}\leqslant 2k\pi+ \frac{\pi}{2}$,  
we get $k\pi- \frac{\pi}{3}\leqslant x\leqslant k\pi+ \frac{\pi}{6}(k\in\mathbb{Z})$,  
so the intervals of increase for the function $f(x)$ are $[k\pi- \frac{\pi}{3},k\pi+ \frac{\pi}{6}](k\in\mathbb{Z})$.  
(Ⅱ) From (Ⅰ) we know $f(x)=\sin (2x+ \frac{\pi}{6})+ \frac{3}{2}+b$,  
since $x\in[0, \frac{7\pi}{12}]$,  
then $2x+ \frac{\pi}{6}\in[ \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{4\pi}{3}]$,  
thus $2x+ \frac{\pi}{6}\in[ \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$, i.e., when $x\in[0, \frac{\pi}{6}]$, the function $f(x)$ is increasing;  
$2x+ \frac{\pi}{6}\in[ \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{4\pi}{3}]$, i.e., when $x\in[ \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{12}]$, the function $f(x)$ is decreasing.  
Also, $f(0)=f( \frac{\pi}{3})$,  
therefore, when $f( \frac{\pi}{3}) > 0\geqslant f( \frac{7\pi}{12})$ or $f( \frac{\pi}{6})=0$, the function $f(x)$ has exactly one zero point.  
That is, $\sin \frac{4\pi}{3}\leqslant -b- \frac{3}{2} < \sin \frac{5\pi}{6}$ or $1+ \frac{3}{2}+b=0$,  
so the range of $b$ that satisfies the condition is $b\in(-2, \frac{\sqrt{3}-3}{2}]\cup\{-\frac{5}{2}\}$.  
Thus, the final answer is $\boxed{b\in(-2, \frac{\sqrt{3}-3}{2}]\cup\{-\frac{5}{2}\}}$.",validation

$(1)$ Write the parametric equation of the line $l$;
$(2)$ Suppose the line $l$ intersects the curve $C$ at two points $A$ and $B$, find the value of $|AB|$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Solution:
$(1)$ The Cartesian coordinate equation of line $l$ is $\sqrt {3}x+y= \sqrt {3}$, which intersects the $y$-axis at $(0, \sqrt {3})$,
$\therefore$ The parametric equation of line $l$ is $\begin{cases} x=- \frac {1}{2}t \\ y= \sqrt {3}+ \frac { \sqrt {3}}{2}t\end{cases}$ (where $t$ is the parameter).
$(2)$ The Cartesian coordinate equation of curve $C$ is $\frac {x^{2}}{4}+ \frac {y^{2}}{6}=1$. Substituting the parametric equation of line $l$ into the equation of the ellipse yields: $3t^{2}+8t-8=0$,
$\therefore t_{1}+t_{2}=- \frac {8}{3}$, $t_{1}t_{2}=- \frac {8}{3}$,
$\therefore|AB|=|t_{1}-t_{2}|= \sqrt { \frac {64}{9}-4\times(- \frac {8}{3})}= \frac {4 \sqrt {10}}{3}$. Therefore, the value of $|AB|$ is $\boxed{\frac {4 \sqrt {10}}{3}}$.",validation

(1) Find the angle $C$;
(2) Determine the range of the perimeter of triangle $\triangle ABC$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","By the sine law, we have the relations:
\[
\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C},
\]
which leads to
\[
a = \sqrt{3} \sin A \quad \text{and} \quad b = \sqrt{3} \sin B.
\]
Therefore, the perimeter $P$ of $\triangle ABC$ can be expressed as
\[
P = a + b + c = \sqrt{3}(\sin A + \sin B) + \frac{3}{2} = \sqrt{3}[\sin A + \sin(A + \frac{\pi}{3})] + \frac{3}{2}.
\]
Simplifying, since $B = \pi - A - C$, we get
\[
P = 3 \sin(A + \frac{\pi}{6}) + \frac{3}{2} \quad \left(\frac{\pi}{6} < A < \frac{\pi}{2}\right).
\]
As $\sin$ has its maximum value of 1 when its argument is $\frac{\pi}{2}$, the perimeter has a maximum when $A + \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{\pi}{2}$, which gives $A = \frac{\pi}{3}$. Therefore,
\[
P_{\text{max}} = 3 \cdot 1 + \frac{3}{2} = \frac{9}{2}.
\]
For the minimum value, since $A$ is greater than $\frac{\pi}{6}$, the smallest value of $P$ occurs when $A$ is as small as possible, which gives us $A$ just above $\frac{\pi}{6}$ and $P$ just above $\frac{3 \sqrt{3} + 3}{2}$. Hence the range for the perimeter is
\[
\boxed{\frac{3 \sqrt{3} + 3}{2} < P \leq \frac{9}{2}}.

Question: Given a circle C: $(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=2$, with its center C on the curve $y= \frac{1}{x}$ (where $x \in [1,2]$). Find the value of $ab$ and the range of lengths of the segment intercepted by the line $l: x+2y=0$ on circle C.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Since the circle C is given by $(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=2$, and its center C lies on the curve $y= \frac{1}{x}$ (where $x \in [1,2]$),  
we have $ab=1$.  
The distance $d$ from the center to the line is $d= \frac{|a+2b|}{\sqrt{5}}= \frac{| \frac{1}{b}+2b|}{\sqrt{5}}$,  
Since $a \in [1,2]$, we have $b \in [\frac{1}{2},1]$,  
Therefore, $d \in [\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{3}{\sqrt{5}}]$,  
Thus, the range of lengths of the segment intercepted by the line $l: x+2y=0$ on circle C is $[\frac{2\sqrt{5}}{5}, \frac{2\sqrt{10}}{5}]$.  
Hence, the answer is $ab=1$, and the range of lengths is $\boxed{[\frac{2\sqrt{5}}{5}, \frac{2\sqrt{10}}{5}]}$.  
From the given circle C: $(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=2$, with its center C on the curve $y= \frac{1}{x}$ (where $x \in [1,2]$), we can determine $ab$ and use the chord length formula to reach the conclusion.

","Let the tangent line with a slope of $1$ on the curve $y=e^{x}$ be $y=x+b$.
Since $y'=e^{x}$, from $e^{x}=1$ we get $x=0$.
Thus, the point of tangency is $(0,1)$.
The distance from the point of tangency to the line $y=x$ is $\frac {1}{ \sqrt {2}}= \frac { \sqrt {2}}{2}$.
Therefore, the shortest distance from point $P$ to the line $y=x$ is $\boxed{\frac { \sqrt {2}}{2}}$.
Hence, the answer is C.
This problem involves finding the coordinates of the point of tangency using derivatives and solving for the distance using the point-to-line distance formula. It is a moderate-level question that tests your understanding of the geometric meaning of derivatives and the application of the point-to-line distance formula.",test

Suppose there are two points $A(x_{1}, y_{1})$, $B(x_{2}, y_{2})$ in a two-dimensional space, with $O$ as the origin. The cosine similarity is the cosine value of the angle between vectors $\overrightarrow{OA}$ and $\overrightarrow{OB}$, denoted as $\cos \left(A,B\right)$, and the cosine distance is $1-\cos \left(A,B\right)$.

Question: According to statistics, the annual income of residents in a city (the total income of all residents in a year, in billion yuan) and the sales of a certain type of goods (in billion yuan) over a period of $10$ years are shown in the table below:

| Year $n$ | $1$ | $2$ | $3$ | $4$ | $5$ | $6$ | $7$ | $8$ | $9$ | $10$ |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|
| Resident Income $x$ | $32.2$ | $31.1$ | $32.9$ | $35.7$ | $37.1$ | $38.0$ | $39.0$ | $43.0$ | $44.6$ | $46.0$ |
| Goods Sales $y$ | $25.0$ | $30.0$ | $34.0$ | $37.0$ | $39.0$ | $41.0$ | $42.0$ | $44.0$ | $48.0$ | $51.0$ |

Based on the table data, the following values of some statistics are obtained:

| $\sum_{i=1}^{10}{x}_{i}$ | $\sum_{i=1}^{10}{y}_{i}$ | $\sum_{10}^{i=1}(x_{i}-\overline{x})^{2}$ | $\sum_{10}^{i=1}(y_{i}-\overline{y})^{2}$ | $\sum_{10}^{i=1}(x_{i}-\overline{x})(y_{i}-\overline{y})$ |

$(1)$ Based on the data in the table, the sample correlation coefficient $r\approx 0.95$. Can it be inferred that the linear correlation between $y$ and $x$ is very strong?  
$(2)$ Based on the values of the statistics and the sample correlation coefficient $r\approx 0.95$, establish the empirical regression equation of $y$ on $x$ (coefficients accurate to $0.01$);  
$(3)$ Based on the regression equation in $(2)$, calculate the residual corresponding to the first sample point $\left(32.2, 25.0\right)$ (accurate to $0.01$); and determine whether the value of $\hat{b}$ will increase or decrease if this sample point is excluded from the regression analysis (no need to provide a reason, just make a judgment).  
Attachment: For a sample $(x_{i}, y_{i}) \left(i=1,2,\cdots ,n\right)$, the correlation coefficient $r=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{({x}_{i}-\overline{x})}({y}_{i}-\overline{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{{({x}_{i}-\overline{x})}^{2}}}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{{({y}_{i}-\overline{y})}^{2}}}}$, $\sqrt{2.297}\approx 1.516$, $\hat{b}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{({x}_{i}-\overline{x})}({y}_{i}-\overline{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{{({x}_{i}-\overline{x})}^{2}}}$, $\hat{a}=\overline{y}-\hat{b}\overline{x}$.

Question: Psychologists have found that students' receptivity depends on the time teachers take to introduce concepts and describe problems. At the beginning of the class, students' interest spikes, there is a fairly constant period of interest, then students' attention begins to wander and stabilize. Analysis and experiments indicate that if the time taken to present and discuss concepts is $x$ (unit: minutes), students' receptivity is $f(x)$ (a higher value of $f(x)$ indicates stronger receptivity),

$$
f(x)= 
\begin{cases} 
-0.1x^2+2.6x+44, & 0<x\leq10 \\
60, & 10<x\leq15 \\
-3x+105, & 15<x\leq25 \\
30, & 25<x\leq40
\end{cases}
$$

(1) How many minutes after the lecture starts is the students' receptivity the strongest? How long does it last?
(2) Compare the students' receptivity after 5 minutes, 20 minutes, and 35 minutes into the lecture.

Question: Given a sequence $\{a_n\}$ that satisfies $S_n + a_n = 2n + 1$, where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms of $\{a_n\}$.
   1. Find $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$;
   2. Conjecture the general formula for $\{a_n\}$ and prove it using mathematical induction.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","2. Conjecture: We suppose that the general term $a_n$ is given by the formula:
   $$a_n = \frac{2 \cdot 2^n - 1}{2^n} = 2 - \frac{1}{2^n} \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}^+).$$
   
   Proof (sketch using mathematical induction):
   
   Base case ($n = 1$):
   We have already established that $a_1 = \frac{3}{2}$, which matches the conjectured formula:
   $$a_1 = 2 - \frac{1}{2^1} = 2 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}.$$
   
   Inductive step:
   Assume that the formula holds for a positive integer $n$, so we have:
   $$a_n = 2 - \frac{1}{2^n}.$$
   
   We need to show that the formula holds for $n + 1$, meaning we must prove:
   $$a_{n+1} = 2 - \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}.$$
   
   Using the recursive relation $a_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2} a_n + 1$, we substitute the assumed form for $a_n$:
   $$a_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2} (2 - \frac{1}{2^n}) + 1 = 1 - \frac{1}{2^{n+1}} + 1 = 2 - \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}.$$
   
   \boxed{a_{n+1} = 2 - \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}}
   
   Thus, the conjectured formula holds for $n+1$, completing the induction step and confirming that the formula is valid for all $n \in \mathbb{N}^+$.",test

Question: Given positive real numbers $a$ and $b$ satisfying $a+b=1$, find the maximum value of $\dfrac {2a}{a^{2}+b}+ \dfrac {b}{a+b^{2}}$.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Since the positive real numbers $a$ and $b$ satisfy $a+b=1$,  
we have $b=1-a$.  
Therefore, $\dfrac {2a}{a^{2}+b}+ \dfrac {b}{a+b^{2}}$  
$= \dfrac {2a}{a^{2}-a+1}+ \dfrac {1-a}{a+(1-a)^{2}}$  
$= \dfrac {2a}{a^{2}-a+1}+ \dfrac {1-a}{a^{2}-a+1}$  
$= \dfrac {a+1}{a^{2}-a+1}$,  
and $\dfrac {a^{2}-a+1}{a+1}$  
$=(a+1)+ \dfrac {3}{a+1}-3$  
$\geqslant 2 \sqrt {(a+1)\cdot \dfrac {3}{a+1}}-3$  
$=2 \sqrt {3}-3$,  
equality holds if and only if $(a+1)^{2}=3$,  
thus $\dfrac {a+1}{a^{2}-a+1}\leqslant \dfrac {1}{2 \sqrt {3}-3}= \dfrac {2 \sqrt {3}+3}{3}$,  
so the answer is $\boxed{\dfrac {2 \sqrt {3}+3}{3}}$.  
By substituting $b=1-a$, we get $\dfrac {2a}{a^{2}+b}+ \dfrac {b}{a+b^{2}}= \dfrac {a+1}{a^{2}-a+1}$, and by finding the minimum value of $\dfrac {a^{2}-a+1}{a+1}$, we obtain the answer.

","By the law of sines, we have: $a=2R\sin A=2\times1\times\sin \dfrac {\pi}{3}= \sqrt {3}$.
Next, we find $\sin B$ using the formula $\sin B = \dfrac{b}{2R} = \dfrac{1}{2\times 1} = \dfrac{1}{2}$.
Since $a= \sqrt {3} > 1=b$, we know that $B$ is an acute angle. Solving for $B$, we get $B= \dfrac {\pi}{6}$.
Then, we can find angle $C$ using the formula $C=\pi-A-B=\pi- \dfrac {\pi}{3}- \dfrac {\pi}{6}= \dfrac {\pi}{2}$.
Finally, the area of the triangle is given by $S_{\triangle ABC}= \dfrac {1}{2}ab\sin C= \dfrac {1}{2}\times \sqrt {3}\times1\times\sin \dfrac {\pi}{2}= \boxed{\dfrac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}$.",test

Question: Given $y=f(x)$ is an odd function defined on $\mathbb{R}$, and when $x<0$, $f(x)=x+2$, then the solution set of the inequality $2f(x)-1<0$ is

B: $\boxed{\{x|x< - \frac {3}{2}\ \text{or}\ 0\leq x< \frac {5}{2}\}}$
C: $\boxed{\{x|- \frac {3}{2}<x\leq 0\}}$
D: $\boxed{\{x|- \frac {3}{2}<x<0\ \text{or}\ 0<x< \frac {5}{2}\}}$

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>

</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Since $y=f(x)$ is an odd function, for $x>0$, we have $-x<0$.  
According to the problem, we get $f(-x)=-f(x)=-x+2$, which means $f(x)=x-2$ for $x>0$.  
When $x<0$, $f(x)=x+2$.  
Substituting into the given inequality, we get $2(x+2)-1<0$, which simplifies to $2x<-3$.  
Solving this gives $x< -\frac {3}{2}$. Therefore, the solution set for the original inequality is $x< -\frac {3}{2}$ for $x<0$.  
When $x\geq0$, $f(x)=x-2$.  
Substituting into the given inequality, we get $2(x-2)-1<0$, which simplifies to $2x<5$.  
Solving this gives $x< \frac {5}{2}$. Therefore, the solution set for the original inequality is $0\leq x< \frac {5}{2}$ for $x\geq0$.  
Overall, the solution set for the inequality is $\boxed{\{x|x< - \frac {3}{2}\ \text{or}\ 0\leq x< \frac {5}{2}\}}$.  
Hence, the correct answer is B.  
By considering $f(x)$ as an odd function, we derive $f(-x)=-f(x)$. Assuming $x>0$, we get $-x<0$, and by substituting into the given expressions, we can simplify to find the expression for $x>0$. Then, considering both cases when $x<0$ and $x>0$, and substituting the corresponding expressions into the given inequality, we obtain two linear inequalities in $x$. The union of the solution sets of these inequalities gives the solution set of the original inequality.  
This question tests the solution of inequalities and the application of the odd-even properties of functions, making it a basic problem.",test

","Solution: The coordinates of the vertex of the hyperbola $\dfrac{x^2}{4} - y^2 = 1$ are $(2,0)$, and the equations of its asymptotes are $y = \pm \dfrac{1}{2}x$.  
Therefore, the distance we are looking for is $\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{\dfrac{1}{4} + 1}} = \dfrac{2\sqrt{5}}{5}$.  
Hence, the answer is $\boxed{\dfrac{2\sqrt{5}}{5}}$.  
To solve this problem, we find the equations of the asymptotes of the hyperbola and the coordinates of the vertex, and then use the formula for the distance from a point to a line.

Question: In $\triangle ABC$, if $\tan A= \frac {1}{3}$, $\angle C=150^{\circ}$, and $BC=1$, then the value of $AB$ is ______.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Since $\tan A= \frac {1}{3}$,  
it follows that $\cos ^{2}A= \frac {1}{\tan ^{2}A+1}= \frac {9}{10}$. Given that $A\in(0,30^{\circ})$,  
thus $\sin A= \frac { \sqrt {10}}{10}$. Also, $\sin C=\sin 150^{\circ}= \frac {1}{2}$ and $BC=1$,  
according to the sine rule, we have: $ \frac {AB}{\sin C}= \frac {BC}{\sin A}$,  
thus $AB= \frac {BC\sin C}{\sin A}= \frac { \frac {1}{2}}{ \frac { \sqrt {10}}{10}}= \frac { \sqrt {10}}{2}$.  
Therefore, the answer is: $\boxed{\frac { \sqrt {10}}{2}}$  
By using the value of $\tan A$ and the range of $A$, we can find the value of $\sin A$ through the basic relationship between trigonometric functions of the same angle. Then, using the values of $\sin C$ and $BC$, we can find the value of $AB$ by applying the sine rule.  
This problem tests the sine rule and the basic relationships between trigonometric functions of the same angle. Mastering theorems and formulas is key to solving this problem, and it is important to pay attention to the range of $A$ when calculating $\sin A$.",test

","(Total 13 points)  
Solution:  
(I) When $a=0$, $\because f(x)=x^{2}e^{-x}$,  
$\therefore f'(x)=(-x^{2}+2x)e^{-x}$, (1 point)  
$\therefore f'(-1)=-3e$. (2 points)  
Also, $\because f(-1)=e$, (3 points)  
$\therefore$ the equation of the tangent line to the curve $y=f(x)$ at the point $(-1,f(-1))$ is:  
$y-e=-3e(x+1)$, which simplifies to $3ex+y+2e=0$. (4 points)  
(II) ""For any $t\in[0,2]$, there exists $s\in[0,2]$ such that $f(s)\geqslant g(t)$ holds"" is equivalent to ""on the interval $[0,2]$, the maximum value of $f(x)$ is greater than or equal to the maximum value of $g(x)$"". (5 points)  
$\because g(x)=x^{2}-x-1=(x- \frac{1}{2})^{2}- \frac{5}{4}$,  
$\therefore$ the maximum value of $g(x)$ on $[0,2]$ is $g(2)=1$.  
$f'(x)=(2x+a)\cdot e^{-x}-(x^{2}+ax-a)\cdot e^{-x}$  
$=-e^{x}[x^{2}+(a-2)x-2a]=e^{-x}(x-2)(x+a)$,  
Setting $f'(x)=0$, we get $x=2$, or $x=-a$. (7 points)  
① When $-a < 0$, i.e., $a > 0$,  
$f'(x) > 0$ always holds on $[0,2]$, $f(x)$ is a monotonically increasing function on $[0,2]$,  
The maximum value of $f(x)$ is $f(2)=(4+a)\cdot \frac{1}{e^{2}}$,  
From $(4+a)\cdot \frac{1}{e^{2}}\geqslant 1$, we get $a\leqslant e^{2}-4$. (9 points)  
② When $0 < -a < 2$, i.e., $-2 < a < 0$,  
When $x\in(0,-a)$, $f'(x) < 0$, $f(x)$ is a monotonically decreasing function,  
When $x\in(-a,2)$, $f'(x) > 0$, $f(x)$ is a monotonically increasing function.  
Therefore, the maximum value of $f(x)$ is either $f(0)=-a$ or $f(2)=(4+a)\cdot \frac{1}{e^{2}}$,  
From $-a\geqslant 1$, we get $a\leqslant -1$; from $(4+a)\cdot \frac{1}{e^{2}}\geqslant 1$, we get $a\leqslant e^{2}-4$.  
Since $-2 < a < 0$, therefore $-2 < a=-1$. (11 points)  
③ When $-a > 2$, i.e., $a < -2$,  
$f'(x) < 0$ always holds on $[0,2]$, $f(x)$ is a monotonically decreasing function on $[0,2]$,  
The maximum value of $f(x)$ is $f(0)=-a$,  
From $-a\geqslant 1$, we get $a\leqslant -1$,  
And since $a < -2$, it follows that $a < -2$.  
In summary, the range of values for the real number $a$ is $\boxed{\{x|a\leqslant -1\} \text{ or } \{x|a\geqslant e^{2}-4\}}$. (13 points)",test

Question: Let the ellipse $$\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ \frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1(a＞b＞0)$$ have its left focus at F, its top vertex at A, and a line through point A perpendicular to AF intersects the ellipse and the positive x-axis at points P and Q, respectively, with AP:PQ = 8:5.  
(1) Find the eccentricity of the ellipse;  
(2) Given that line l passes through point M(-3,0) with an angle of inclination $$\frac {π}{6}$$, and circle C passes through points A, Q, F, if line l is tangent to circle C, find the equation of the ellipse.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","(1) Let point Q be $(x_0,0)$, F be $(-c,0)$, and P be $(x,y)$, where $$c= \sqrt {a^{2}-b^{2}}$$, and A be $(0,b)$.  
Since AP:PQ = 8:5, we have $$\overrightarrow {AP}= \frac {8}{13} \overrightarrow {AQ}$$,  
thus $$(x,y-b)= \frac {8}{13}(x_{0},-b)$$, we get $$P\left( \frac {8}{13}x_{0}, \frac {5}{13}b\right)$$,  
Point P lies on the ellipse, thus $$\left( \frac {8}{13}\right)^{2} \frac {x_{0}^{2}}{a^{2}}+\left( \frac {5}{13}\right)^{2}=1 \Rightarrow x_{0}= \frac {3}{2}a$$.  
And $$\overrightarrow {FA}=(c,b), \overrightarrow {AQ}=(x_{0},-b), \overrightarrow {FA} \perp \overrightarrow {AQ}$$,  
thus $$\overrightarrow {FA}\cdot \overrightarrow {AQ}=0$$.  
Thus $$cx_{0}-b^{2}=0, x_{0}= \frac {b^{2}}{c}$$.  
From the above, we know $2b^{2}=3ac$,  
thus $2c^{2}+3ac-2a^{2}=0$.  
thus $2e^{2}+3e-2=0$,  
thus $$e= \frac {1}{2}$$.  
(2) From the given, the equation of line l is $$y= \frac { \sqrt {3}}{3}(x+3)$$, i.e., $$x- \sqrt {3}y+3=0$$.  
The center of the circle that meets the conditions is $$O′\left( \frac {b^{2}-c^{2}}{2c},0\right)$$,  
And since $a=2c$, $$\frac {b^{2}-c^{2}}{2c}= \frac {a^{2}-c^{2}-c^{2}}{2c}=c$$, thus $O′(c,0)$.  
The radius of the circle $$r= \frac { \frac {b^{2}}{c}+2}{2}= \frac {a^{2}}{2c}=a$$.  
From the circle being tangent to line l: $$x- \sqrt {3}y+3=0$$, we get $$\frac {|c+3|}{2}=a$$,  
And since $a=2c$, $$c=1, a=2, b= \sqrt {3}$$.  
Thus, the equation of the ellipse is $$\boxed{\frac {x^{2}}{4}+ \frac {y^{2}}{3}=1}$$.",test

Question: Given $f(\alpha)= \frac {\sin (\alpha-3\pi)\cos (2\pi-\alpha)\sin (-\alpha+ \frac {3\pi}{2})}{\cos (-\pi -\alpha )\sin (-\pi -\alpha )}$  
$(1)$ Simplify $f(\alpha)$  
$(2)$ If $\alpha$ is an angle in the third quadrant, and $\cos (\alpha- \frac {3\pi}{2})= \frac {1}{5}$, find the value of $f(\alpha)$.

</answer>
","Solution:  
$(1) f(\alpha)= \frac {-\sin \alpha\cos ^{2}\alpha}{\cos \alpha \sin \alpha }=-\cos \alpha$;  
$(2)$ Since $\cos (\alpha- \frac {3\pi}{2})=-\sin \alpha= \frac {1}{5}$, then $\sin \alpha=- \frac {1}{5}$,  
Since $\alpha$ is an angle in the third quadrant, then $\cos \alpha=- \sqrt {1-\sin ^{2}\alpha}=- \frac {2 \sqrt {6}}{5}$,  
Thus, $f(\alpha)=-\cos \alpha= \boxed{\frac {2 \sqrt {6}}{5}}$.",test

Answer the question and return in the following format:

...
</answer>
","1. $f(x)= \sqrt {2}\sin x+m\cos x= \sqrt {m^{2}+2}\sin (x+\phi)(\tan \phi= \frac { \sqrt {2}m}{2})$
Knowing that the maximum value of $f(x)$ is $\sqrt {m^{2}+2}$, let $\sqrt {m^{2}+2}=2$, we get $m= \sqrt {2}$. The smallest positive period of $f(x)$ is $T= \frac {2\pi}{1}=2\pi$.
2. From part 1, we know when $m= \sqrt {2}$, $f(x)=2\sin (x+ \frac {\pi}{4})$.
Then $f(A- \frac {\pi}{4})+f(B- \frac {\pi}{4})=12 \sqrt {2}\sin A\sin B$, we get $\sin A+\sin B=6 \sqrt {2}\sin A\sin B$.
Using the sine law $\frac {a}{\sin A}= \frac {b}{\sin B}= \frac {c}{\sin C}=2 \sqrt {2}$, we get $\sin A= \frac {a}{2 \sqrt {2}}$, $\sin B= \frac {b}{2 \sqrt {2}}$.
Thus, $a+b=3ab$.
Using the cosine law $c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\cos C$, we get $c^{2}=(a+b)^{2}-2ab-2ab\cos C$, which simplifies to $3a^{2}b^{2}-ab-2=0$.
Solving this equation, we get $ab=1$ (we discard the negative solution).
Therefore, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $S_{\triangle ABC}= \frac {1}{2}ab\sin C=\boxed{\frac { \sqrt {3}}{4}}$.",test

Question: When solving some more complex one-variable quadratic equations, the ""root shrinking method"" can be used to simplify the calculations. The ""root shrinking method"" refers to first transforming the one-variable quadratic equation into a new one-variable quadratic equation with simpler coefficients, solving the new equation, and then shrinking the two roots of the new equation by the same factor to obtain the two roots of the original equation. Given: The two roots of the one-variable quadratic equation about $x$, $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$ $(a\neq 0)$ are $x_{1}=\alpha$, $x_{2}=\beta$. Find the two roots of the one-variable quadratic equation about $x$, $p^{2}ax^{2}+pbx+c=0$ $(ap\neq 0)$. 

**Solution:**  
Since $p^{2}ax^{2}+pbx+c=0$ $(ap\neq 0)$, therefore $a(px)^{2}+b\cdot px+c=0$. Let $px=t$,  
we get the new equation $at^{2}+bt+c=0$.  
Since the roots of the new equation are $t_{1}=\alpha$, $t_{2}=\beta$, therefore $px=\alpha$, $px=\beta$,  
thus the roots of the original equation are ${x}_{1}=\frac{\alpha}{p}$, ${x}_{2}=\frac{\beta}{p}$.  
This method of solving one-variable quadratic equations is called the ""root shrinking method"".  
For example, using the root shrinking method to solve the equation $49x^{2}+35x-24=0$.  
**Solution:**  
Since $49=7^{2}$, $35=5\times 7$, therefore $(7x)^{2}+5\times 7x-24=0$. Let $7x=t$,  
we get the new equation $t^{2}+5t-24=0$.  
Solving the new equation gives $t_{1}=3$, $t_{2}=-8$, therefore $7x=3$, $7x=-8$,  
thus the roots of the original equation are ${x}_{1}=\frac{3}{7}$, ${x}_{2}=-\frac{8}{7}$.  
Please use the above information to solve the following problems and write out the specific steps:  
$(1)$ Solve the equation using the root shrinking method: $36x^{2}-6x-1=0$;  
$(2)$ Solve the equation using the root shrinking method: $3x^{2}-160x+1600=0$.

Question: Given vectors $\overrightarrow{a}$ and $\overrightarrow{b}$ with an angle $\theta$ between them, if $\overrightarrow{a}=(3,-1)$ and $\overrightarrow{b}- \overrightarrow{a}=(-1,1)$, then $\cos \theta=$ ______.

Answer the question and return in the following format:

<think>
...
</think>

<answer>
...
</answer>
","Since $\overrightarrow{a}=(3,-1)$ and $\overrightarrow{b}- \overrightarrow{a}=(-1,1)$,  
we have $\overrightarrow{b}=(2,0)$.  
Therefore, $|\overrightarrow{a}|= \sqrt{10}$, $|\overrightarrow{b}|=2$, and $\overrightarrow{a}\cdot \overrightarrow{b}=6$.  
Thus, $\cos \theta= \frac{\overrightarrow{a}\cdot \overrightarrow{b}}{|\overrightarrow{a}|\cdot |\overrightarrow{b}|}= \frac{6}{2\sqrt{10}}= \frac{3\sqrt{10}}{10}$.  
So, the answer is $\boxed{\frac{3\sqrt{10}}{10}}$.  
This can be solved by using the operations of vector coordinates and the formula for the angle between vectors.  
It examines the operations of scalar multiplication and subtraction of vector coordinates, the operation of the dot product of vector coordinates, and the cosine formula for the angle between vectors.",test
