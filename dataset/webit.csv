Question: What would happen if sellers must begin paying a tax on some good that has perfectly elastic demand but only somewhat elastic supply?

- The total cost to consumers would remain the same, so sellers would bear the entire burden of the tax.

- The total cost to consumers would increase by less than the full amount of the tax, so buyers and sellers both would bear some of the tax burden.

- The total cost to consumers would increase by the full amount of the tax, so buyers would bear the entire burden of the tax.

- The total cost to consumers would increase by more than the amount of the tax, so buyers would bear the full tax burden and transfer more to sellers.

Question: Your boss has asked you to evaluate the economics of replacing 1,000 60-Watt incandescent light bulbs (ILBs) with 1,000 compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) for a particular lighting application. During your investigation, you discover that 13-watt CFLs costing $2.10 each will provide the same illumination as standard 60-Watt ILBs costing $0.50 each. Interestingly, CFLs last, on average, eight times as long as incandescent bulbs. The average life of an ILB is one year over the anticipated usage of 1,000 hours each year.

Each incandescent bulb costs $2.00 to install/replace. Installation of a single CFL costs $3.10, and it will also be used 1,000 hours per year. Electricity costs $0.12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), and you decide to compare the two lighting options over an 8-year study period. If the MARR is 15% per year compare the economics of the two alternatives and write a brief of your findings for a report to the boss.

Question: To correct GDP for price index changes, we first have to pick a price index (the GDP deflator) with a specific year as its base. In our example, the base year is 2005. The price index for that year is 100. To obtain 2005 constant-dollar GDP, we divide the price index into nominal GDP and multiply by 100. In other words, we divide column 3 into column 2 and multiply by 100. This gives us column 4, which (taking into account rounding of the deflator) is a measure of real GDP expressed in 2005 purchasing power.

Question: Consider the market for kazoos. Assume that kazoos are produced by a number of identical firms. These firms all behave as price takers and are able to adjust all of their inputs quickly (thus they are always producing on their long-run cost curves). Because of a host of onerous regulatory requirements that were successfully lobbied for by the American Federation of Kazoo Manufacturers (AFKM), entry of new manufacturers to the market takes time. Thus, in the short run, the price can rise above minimum long-run average cost.

Assume that each firm's cost function is given by {eq}C(q) = 5Q^3 - 120Q^2 + 1000Q

{/eq}

After the Captains of Kazoo (a Belgian Kazoo Quintet) win the Eurovision song contest, demand for kazoos skyrockets. Suppose that in period 1 we observe a market clearing price of $1,000 and a total of 16,000 kazoos sold.

The presence of positive profits in the kazoo industry induces entry, and by period 2, enough firms have overcome the regulatory burdens to return the market to its long-run equilibrium.

Question: A well-known State deregulated the wholesale market for electricity in which its private utility companies purchased the extra power needed to make up for the generation capacity they lacked. However, the State did not also deregulate the retail rate consumers pay for the power usage. Unfortunately, the wholesale market price of electricity soared during the peak-demand, hot summer months. Thus utility companies faced bankruptcy because they could not pass the wholesale rate increases on to customers as retail rates increased.

Since the State's power plants were already producing at their capacity (and capacity increases could not be undertaken for several years due to lengthy construction times), how might the States' private power plants use ""rolling brownouts"" to change the supply of power to the end user? The brownouts are planned power outages which _____ the supply of power available to be consumed.

","Market equilibrium is generated at the intersection of the demand and supply curves. The demand curve is derived from the marginal benefit curve, representing the maximum price consumers are willing to pay at each quantity. The supply curve is derived from the marginal cost curve, representing the additional cost of producing one more unit. The market tends to hover at this intersection because at this equilibrium point, the marginal benefit of the last unit sold equals the marginal cost of producing it. Any deviation from this point creates opposing demand and supply forces that push the market back towards equilibrium.",train

B. there will be still a net expansionary effect on the equilibrium level of output and income, although there is an increase of R300 in taxes.

C. the multiplier effect for an increase in government spending will be higher than the backwards multiplier effect for an increase in taxes since the multiplier starts to operate from 300 in the case of government spending and the case of taxes operates through the change in disposable income.

Question: Suppose we believe that the use of illegal drugs is a public bad - that is, that one person's drug use imposes a negative externality on the rest of society. (This could happen, for example, through increased rates of other crime and general lawlessness, or through health consequences that must be paid for through higher taxes.)

Anti-drug enforcement means that both suppliers and buyers face a risk of being caught and punished. This raises the marginal cost for suppliers, and also raises the effective price of drugs faced by buyers (the cash price plus the expected punishment).

Casual drug users tend to have very elastic demand - so higher prices lead to lower consumption, reducing the social cost of drug use and the cost of punishing those who are caught. Drug addicts, on the other hand. Have very inelastic demand, so increased prices have little deterrence effect. In addition, many addicts support their habit through robberies and other crimes, so higher prices lead to more crimes by drug addicts (to support the same level of use at higher prices).

Based on these facts, Cooter and Ulen argue that the ideal drug policy might be a high price of drugs for casual users, but a low price for addicts. Which of the two proposals described above - the crackdown on suppliers or the crackdown on buyers - comes closer to achieving this goal?

The legislative package may reduce the number of smokers in the most populous U.S. city by 160,000 over the next three years. Tobacco kills an estimated 12,000 annually in NYC.

Question: Suppose that, as a member of Team Econ, you are asked to model the economic problem facing members of a representative tribal household from the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon. Being an economist you frame the work as one of modeling the allocation of total monthly, after-tax income ($1,725) between basic necessities?these include rent for housing, food for subsistence, transportation to work and utilities?versus discretionary purchases of goods and services. There are only three discretionary goods or services that are of interest here: fine hand-cut Czech beads, leather and lessons in the CHINUK WAWA language. Based upon information and belief, you believe the household typically spends $900 on rent, $300 on food, $150 on transportation and $75 on utilities. Subsequently, the representative household?s income increases by $500 when the tribal casino reduces retained earning and shares its profits with the membership. Based on this information, which of the following statements is true?

a) If the household spends $500 rather than $300 on food, it follows that food is a ""normal"" good and the demand for food is elastic with respect to income in this range.

b) If the household spends just $10 of the additional $500 it receives on cut beads, it follows that cut beads are an ""inferior"" good and income inelastic within this range.

c) If the household spends all $500 on additional CHINUK WAWA lessons, it follows that language lessons are a ""luxury"" good and the income elasticity of demand is equal to 1.0, i.e., it is unit elastic.

d) If the household increases its purchases of leather by the same percentage as the increase in income, it follows that leather is a ""normal"" good and the income elasticity of demand for leather equals -1.0.

Question: The Ocean Pacific fleet has just decided to use a pole-and-line method of fishing instead of gill netting to catch tuna. The latter method involves the use of miles of nets strung out across the ocean and therefore entraps other sea creatures besides tuna (e.g., porpoises, sea turtles). Concern for endangered species was one reason for this decision, but perhaps more important was the fact that the major tuna canneries in the United States will no longer accept tuna caught by gill netting. Ocean Pacific decided to conduct a series of experiments to determine the amount of tuna that could be caught with different crew sizes. The results of these experiments follow:

Question: In the past, many employers agreed to pay employees medical benefits when they retired in return for wage concessions. These retiree medical costs were paid as they occurred and were not funded, as would occur with a pension obligation. A new accounting rule required these firms to set aside funds to pay for these retiree benefits. These unfunded liabilities were huge. Did the firms raise their prices to pay off these liabilities, thereby hurting US competitiveness?

A. No, the firms deducted these retiree benefits from employees' wages and thus did not have to raise prices.

B. Yes, to earn the funds to pay these unfunded liabilities, the firms had to raise their prices, thereby making US products more expensive than foreign-produced products.

C. No, the firms' profit decreased as they had to pay these contracted liabilities as earned by their employees, and the value of the firms declined to account for this liability.

D. No, the government agreed to subsidize these liabilities so that the firms would not have to raise their prices and sell fewer products overseas.

Fewer American doctors are treating patients enrolled in the Medicare health program for seniors, reflecting frustration with its payment rates and pushback against mounting rules, according to health experts -- just as millions of Americans are poised to gain access to such coverage under the new health law next year. Some Americans may have difficulty finding doctors who will take their new benefits or face long waits for appointments with those who do. Some experts attribute the rise in defections to Medicare payment rates that haven't kept pace with inflation and the threat of more cuts to come. Under a budgetary formula enacted by Congress in 1997, physicians could see Medicare reimbursements slashed by 25% in 2014 unless Congress intervenes to delay the cuts, which it has done several times. Show the effects on Medicare patients.

","Due to low payment rates from Medicare, fewer doctors are willing to treat Medicare patients.  The supply of doctors willing to treat these patients shifts to the left.

As a result, there is a shortage of doctors for Medicare patients. This is depicted as excess demand (Q1 - Q) in the graph.",validation

The increase in the cost of providing tertiary education leads to a decrease in supply, shifting the supply curve to the left.  The combined effect is a definite decrease in equilibrium quantity. The effect on equilibrium price is indeterminate; it depends on the relative magnitudes of the demand and supply shifts. If the shifts are equal, the equilibrium price will remain the same. If the demand shift is greater than the supply shift, the equilibrium price will decline.

Question: According to The Wall Street Journal, Mitsubishi Motors recently announced a major restructuring plan in an attempt to reverse declining global sales. Suppose that as part of the restructuring plan Mitsubishi conducts an analysis of how labor and capital are used in its production process. Prior to restructuring, Mitsubishi's marginal rate of technical substitution is 0.13 (in absolute value). To hire workers, suppose that Mitsubishi must pay the competitive hourly wage of 1,540 yen.

In the study of its production process and markets where capital is procured, suppose that Mitsubishi determines that its marginal productivity of capital is 0.65 small cars per hour at its new targeted level of output and that capital is procured in a highly competitive market. The same study indicates that the average selling price of Mitsubishi s smallest car is 1,150,000 yen.

Determine the marginal productivity of labor at its new targeted level of output. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.

Question: A small college has space for a maximum of 1,000 students. The college can identify 500 of its students who are willing to pay $20,000 per year and 500 students who are willing to pay $10,000 per year. The college gas annual fixed costs of $10 million, and the variable cost for each additional student is $5,000. To continue operating, the college must receive payments equal to its total cost (that is, total fixed costs + total variable costs).

Suppose a rich donor offers to pay all of the fixed costs at the college to make sure that it can stay in operation. However, because he opposes price discrimination on moral grounds, the donor places one condition on his offer: From now on, the school must charge all of its students the same amount. That is, it should ask everyone to pay the same tuition and offer no financial aid.

Assuming the college chooses the price that maximizes its profits, would this condition lead to an increase in social welfare, as measured by the sum of consumer and producer surplus?

Question: Biological pest control has high fixed costs associated with machinery and predator rearing. Farmers experience substantial ""learning by doing"" and they depend on ""network externalities"", information gained from fellow farmers and university extension agents. Additionally, if neighboring farmers are spraying conventional pesticides, the pesticides will also kill off natural predators raised for biological control. Suppose we can have an average cost function per ton of output for an individual farmer using biological control methods as follows:

{eq}AC_b = $200 - 0.1y_b - 0.01X_b + 0.01X_c

Question: You are an assistant to a senator who chairs an ad hoc committee on reforming taxes on telecommunication services. Based on your research, AT&T has spent over $15 million on related paperwork and compliance costs. Moreover, depending on the locale, telecom taxes can amount to as much as 25% of a consumer's phone bill. These high tax rates on telecom services have become quite controversial, due to the fact that the deregulation of the telecom industry has led to a highly competitive market. Your best estimates indicate that based on current tax rates, the monthly market demand for telecommunication services is given by {eq}Q_d  = 200 - 4P

{/eq} and the market supply (including taxes) is {eq}Q_s = 4P - 120

{/eq} (both in millions), where {eq}P

{/eq} is the monthly price of the telecommunication services. The senator is considering tax reform that would dramatically cut tax rates, leading to a supply function under the new tax policy of {eq}Q_s = 4.4P - 120

{/eq}. How much money per unit would a typical consumer save each month as a result of the proposed legislation?

Question: Suppose we have a production system where there is a known production function $f(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)$ that gives the amount of the commodity produced as a function of the amounts $x_i$ of the inputs, $i=1,2,\dots,n$. the unit price of the produced commodity is $q$ and the unit prices of the input are $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$. The producer wishing to maximize profit must solve the problem : maximize $qf(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)-p_1x_1- p_2x_2-\dots p_nx_n$ Now if I apply the first order necessary condition to this function then the equation we get can be interpreted as ""at the solution the marginal value due to a small increase in the $i$-th input must be equal to the price $p_i$"".

Question: The local Shreveport-Bossier Paralegal Union has observed that the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that employment of paralegals over the next decade will rise considerably faster than the employment of lawyers, and suggests that all paralegals now push for wages of $26.50 per hour. Feeling like their future is safe, most paralegals now reduce the stress in their lives by only writing on average two briefs per hour. If the other values remain the same (attorney wage and writing speed, need for 24 briefs per hour), would the company save money in the writing of the 24 legal briefs by hiring the four new paralegals and firing some attorneys?

Select one:

a. No. The cost of the four paralegals is less than the cost of two attorneys, so paralegals produce a single legal brief more expensively than attorneys.

b. No. The decreased productivity and higher wage results in the marginal product per dollar of paralegals being below the marginal product per dollar of lawyers. The cost of using only lawyers is now cheaper than using four paralegals and four lawyers.

c. Yes. The four paralegals can produce a single legal brief at a cheaper cost than a single attorney, so hiring them leads to a lower total cost.

d. Yes. The higher productivity of the attorneys matters less than the fact that they are more expensive to hire. The cheaper paralegals should be hired, even if their productivity is slightly lower, since the total cost is lower.

Question: There's a gas shortage in Gasland. You're presented with two proposals that will achieve the same level of reduction in the use of gas.

Proposal A would force everybody to reduce their gas consumption by 7 percent (regulatory policy).

Proposal B would impose a tax of 50 cents on the consumption of a gallon of gas, which would also achieve a reduction of 7 percent.

Consumers of gas can be divided into two groups - one group whose demand is elastic and another group whose demand is inelastic.

How will the proposals affect each group? Briefly explain.

a. With both proposals, each group will demand less oil. Their demand curves will shift down.

b. Proposal A would result in a lower quantity of oil demanded (movement along the demand curve). Proposal B would result in less oil demanded (demand curve shifts).

Question: From an economics perspective, would you prefer your residential water supply to be provided by a monopolist or a purely competitive firm?

1. I would prefer to have my water supply provided by a purely competitive firm just because it will be offered at a good price since many firms are competing to get as much profit as they can. Consumers really decide on what they are willing to pay rather than being told how much they need to pay. Since monopolist are price makers, they can change the product price by changing the quantity of the product it produces. The monopolist will use this power whenever they can take advantage of the situation.

2. I would prefer a purely competitive firm to handle the water supply. I believe that when competition is involved with providing services, that the price benefits the consumer. A monopoly will produce at a price were it is greater than its marginal cost, to put more money in their pockets. If a competitive market is established for water supply, we as consumers will benefit from being able to choose which company will get us the best option for our dollars. Its just like cable, here where I live, we have one cable provider. They increase prices, scaled back on services, and provide horrible service. If a competitor was to come in a provide cable, I would be willing to bet that they would increase services, better price packages, and think more about customer satisfaction.

Question: Like many other investors, you are a  Fed watcher,  who constantly monitors any actions taken by the Fed to revise monetary policy. You believe that three key factors affect interest rates. Assume that the most important factor is the Fed's monetary policy. The second most important factor is the state of the economy, which influences the demand for loanable funds. The third factor is the level of inflation, which also influences the demand for loanable funds.

Because monetary policy can affect interest rates, it affects economic growth as well. By controlling monetary policy, the Fed influences the prices of all types of securities. The following information is available:   Economic growth has been consistently strong over the past few years but is beginning to slow down. Unemployment is as low as it has been in the past decade but has risen slightly over the past two quarters.   Inflation has been about 5 percent per year for the past few years.   The dollar has been strong. Oil prices have been very low.

Yesterday, an event occurred that you believe will cause much higher oil prices in the United States and a weaker U.S. economy in the near future. You plan to determine whether the Fed will respond to the economic problems that are likely to develop. You have reviewed previous economic slowdowns caused by a decline in the aggregate demand for goods and services and found that each slowdown precipitated a loose money policy by the Fed.

Inflation was 3 percent or less in each of the previous economic slowdowns. Interest rates generally declined in response to these policies and the U.S. economy improved. Assume that the Fed's philosophy regarding monetary policy is to maintain economic growth and low inflation. There does not appear to be any major fiscal policy forthcoming that will have a major effect on the economy. Thus, the future economy is up to the Fed. The Fed's present policy is to maintain a 2 percent annual growth rate in the money supply.

You believe that the economy is headed toward a recession unless the Fed uses a very stimulating monetary policy, such as a 10 percent annual growth rate in the money supply. The general consensus of economists is that the Fed will revise its monetary policy to stimulate the economy for three reasons:

(1) It recognizes the potential costs of higher unemployment if a recession occurs

(2) It has consistently used a stimulating policy in the past to prevent recessions

(3) The administration has been pressuring the Fed to use a stimulating monetary policy.

Although you will consider the economists  opinions, you plan to make your own assessment of the Fed's future policy. Two quarters ago, GDP declined by 1 percent. Last quarter, GDP declined again by 1 percent. Thus, there is clear evidence that the economy has recently slowed down.

Do you think that the Fed will use a stimulating monetary policy at this point? Explain.

One possibility is a greater supply of workers today compared to 50 years ago leading to lower wages.  Another possibility relates to the state of the economy. If the economy 50 years ago was not at full employment, additional inputs (workers) could have resulted in increasing returns, justifying higher wages.  Finally, less competition due to a lack of liberalization and globalization in the past could have allowed firms to charge higher prices, increasing profit margins and enabling higher wages.",test

Question: Suppose MU1 (2,3) = 7 ; I'm having a really hard time understanding this for some reason, how would one more of good one make seven? Is it that one unit of good one is worth 2 utils and one unit of good two is worth 3 utils so that if you added one more unit of good one it would be 2+2+3=7? I keep seeing it explained as ""if you are consuming 2 units of good one and 3 units of good two, then 1 additional unit of good one will increase my utility by 7 utils"" but wouldn't that be 5? I just can't quite grasp what the reasoning and math is behind this answer, do I need to take a derivative of something? I'm confused.

Question: A faculty member sells Gatorade at UNC Charlotte football games. He finds that if he raises his selling price by $1, he sells 5 less bottles each week. He turns over the operation to a Managerial Economics student for a week. The goal is to maximize revenue since the faculty member has a vast supply of Gatorade, and any unsold bottles can be sold in future weeks. The student takes over the operation for a week. She says she sold 30 bottles at the last game, and that is the optimal quantity that maximized revenue.

What price did the student sell the Gatorade for?
